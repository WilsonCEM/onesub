22
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:36,001
更精确的结果。这就是为什么我们要向

我连我的地址薄都进不去了
I can't even access my address book.

48
00:04:56,459 --> 00:04:59,334
恕我直言，教授，我们现在讨论的事有关职业生涯！
With all due respect, Professor, We're talking about career here !

49
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:02,417
如果我的研究得不到新的资金，我就失业了
If they don't refinance my research, I'm out of a job.

50
00:05:02,626 --> 00:05:04,792
什么？我们进行得不错！
What ? We're doing fine !

51
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:08,751
现在我们需要寻求政策性保护，我早已着手在办了
Now we need to find some political protection, and I've already dealt with that.

52
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:11,417
我一点都不明白这些政治手段...
I don't understand this political thing at all...

00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:15,417
左手第二位是华盛顿的德·米塔的秘书
The second from the left was secretary to De Mita in the DC,

54
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:20,126
我是在1986年阿韦利诺举办的君主主义大会上认识他的
and I met him '86 at a monarchists' convention in Avellino.

55
00:05:20,334 --> 00:05:23,542
- 我跟他说你是我们的人   - 什么我们？
- I said you were one of ours.   - Our what ?

56
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:27,251
- 共融与自由团体   - 是吗，我不是太...
- Communion and Liberation.   - Really, I'm not exactly...

57
00:05:27,459 --> 00:05:31,334
这他妈有什么关系，彼得罗？关键是他笑了
And why the fuck should that matter Pietro ? What matters is that he smiled.

58
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:35,001
你知道那意味着什么吗？一份长期合同
You know what that means ? A long-term contract.

59
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,292
但愿如此！我希望资金能够比较稳定
I wish ! I could really use some financial stability.

60
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,251
没错，不过，考虑一下，我们能不能试试重启下手机？
Yes, but, as a scruple, shall we try and reset the device ?

61
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:44,376
教授，我很忙，明天再试吧
Professor, I'm in a rush, I'll do it tomorrow.

62
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,209
我就这样守着用不起来的手机过一下午？
And I would have to spend all afternoon with my cell phone not working ?

63
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:49,209
你确实要走的话，走吧
If you have to go, go.

64
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:51,917
我会找你的同事贾科梅蒂让他试试
I'll ask your colleague Giacometti and he'll do it.

65
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:56,792
这关贾科梅蒂什么事？让我来吧
What's Giacometti got to do with it ? I'll do it.

66
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,834
你去哪了？快4点了！
Where have you been ? It's nearly 4 !

67
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,334
我跟教授碰上点事情...
I had a problem with the professor...

68
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,542
看看，彼得罗！情况真要命
Look at this, Pietro ! The situation's tragic.

69
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:09,459
- 孩子们都在吗？   - 他们已经等了半个小时了！
- Are the kids here ?   - They've been waiting for half an hour !

70
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,834
- 这是什么，法院的？   - 电梯帐单
- What is it, the court ?   - The elevator bill.

71
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:15,459
- 这是交钱的指令！   - 该死的电梯！
- It's an order to pay !   - That fucking elevator !

72
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,417
我才不要电梯，我不想为它付钱，我才不用它！
I don't want an elevator, I don't want to pay for it, I don't use it !

73
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:22,751
干嘛要把它发给我们？我们有律师的，我亲爱的朋友，维托利奥...
Why did they send it to us ? We have a lawyer, my dear friend, Vittorio...

74
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:25,001
他学的是教会法规！
He's got a degree in canon law !

75
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:26,501
他的头脑非常聪明
He's got a brain like this.

76
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:29,376
维托利奥是教皇的最后通谕的代笔人
Vittorio was the ghost-writer for the Pope's last encyclical.

77
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:31,626
- 好吧...   - 而且他不收费
- All right...   - And he's free.

78
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,376
- 我得去上课了   - 要确保能拿到薪水！
- I need to do my lesson.   - Make sure you get paid !

79
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:37,251
要是你不去找他们，我去！
If you don't ask them, I will !

80
00:06:37,459 --> 00:06:40,626
嘘！求你把它放下来！我去找他们
Ssh ! Keep it down, please ! I'll tell them.

81
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:48,959
各位，抱歉我来晚了，我被一点小事缠住了
Guys, sorry I'm late, but I had a bit of a busy clay.

82
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:52,126
原因就不讲了... 好吧，把你们的书翻开到...
You don't need to know... Right, open your book at...

83
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:56,251
- 你们在抽大麻？   - 我们在等...
- Are you smoking a joint ?   - While we were waiting...

84
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,959
等什么等？马上给我扔了！
While you were waiting ? Put that out right now !

85
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,917
你们不是开玩笑吧？
Are you being serious ?

86
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:04,667
她平时跟戒毒的人打交道
She works with recovering addicts,

87
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:07,084
她会把这当作对她的挑衅，而且她是对的！
she'd see it as a provocation and she'd be right !

88
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:10,626
- 至少等到她离开！   - 我走了
- At least wait till she leaves !   - I'm going.

89
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:16,084
- 你们在抽大麻吗？   - 没有，有人在楼下煎东西
- Are you smoking a joint ?   - No, someone's frying downstairs...

90
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:18,834
你要确保能拿到薪水！
Make sure you get paid !

91
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:22,667
嗯，其实...
Yes, in fact...

92
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:31,001
我一直在想，在我们进行这三个月课程的同时
I was thinking, in parallel with the three-month course we're doing,

93
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:37,834
我们也许可以讨论下报酬的事，比如说...
we could also maybe begin a discourse about remuneration, let's say...

94
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,251
意思是...你们准备什么时候付我钱？
meaning... when are you going to pay me ?

95
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,084
教授，我们说过的，你要干到一半再说
Professor, we said before, you have to meet us halfway.

96
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,626
我已经干到一半了
I am meeting you halfway,

97
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,959
可你们每人欠我500多欧元
but you owe me more than 500 euros each.

98
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,959
这不是针对个人，我并不是对你们有想法
It's not personal, I've not got it in for you,

99
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,084
你们给我报酬是天经地义的事
it's a general thing to do with all of you.

100
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,459
- 毛里齐奥？   - 他在那边躺着呢
- Maurizio ?   - He's lying down over there.

101
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:01,334
那边，这么一小会，又一次？他不是玩真的吧！
Over there, a moment, again ? He cannot be serious !

102
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:03,751
他把这儿当旅馆了？
Does he think this apartment is a hotel ?

103
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:08,626
他跑过来，上了一节课，然后躺了下来！我是说...
He comes here, does a lesson, then lies down ! I mean...

104
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,626
- 毛里齐奥！   - 再给我五分钟，教授，请你...
- Maurizio !   - Five minutes more, Prof, please...

105
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,292
不，不，没有五分钟
No, no, no five minutes,

106
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,917
而且我告诉过你上床之前起码把牛仔裤脱了
and I'd asked you to at least take your jeans off when you get into bed.

107
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,959
请把门关上，外面光太强了！
Please ! Close the door, there's too much light coming in !

108
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:23,542
我的头脑要炸了，再给我五分钟就好
My head's bursting, five minutes and I'll be with you.

109
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,126
没有五分钟！起来跟别人一样去上你的课
No five minutes ! Get up and come for your lesson like everyone else.

110
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,376
真不敢相信！
Can you believe this ?

111
00:08:30,584 --> 00:08:33,376
- 你们去哪？   - 时间到了，我约了6点钟去跳舞
- Where are you going ?   - Time's up, I've got dance at 6.

112
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:35,792
- 好吧，我们说好的事呢？   - 周三见
- All right, and what did we agree ?   - See you on Wednesday.

113
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,417
不，关于钱的
No, about the money.

114
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:41,001
教授，发生了危机，你没读报纸吗？找找看
Prof, there's a crisis, don't you read the papers ? Mark it down.

115
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:42,751
什么...？
What...?

116
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,584
等等，你们打算把毛里齐奥丢给我？
Hang on, are you leaving Maurizio with me ?

117
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:05,126
我跟维托利奥谈过了，不得不说他确实让我放心了
I spoke with Vittorio and I have to say he really reassured me,

118
00:09:05,334 --> 00:09:08,792
因为他说交钱的指令并不是最终判决
because he says the order to pay isn't like a definitive sentence.

119
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,042
所以我们可以提出反对，多争取些时间
So we can oppose it and gain some time.

120
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,126
只是一桩小事，亲爱的。我会拿到我的合同，这样我们就能...
It's only a matter of clays, love, I'll get my contract and we can...

121
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:19,709
毛里齐奥，我觉得你最好去做次全面体检
Maurizio, I think you should go for a thorough general checkup,

122
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,334
因为从你睡觉的样子看，有可能是嗜睡症的初始阶段
because the way you fall asleep, it could be first-stage narcolepsy.

123
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:26,209
- 这不是玩笑，你懂的   - 我不觉得...
- It's serious, you know.   - I don't think so...

124
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:29,667
因为我今天早上6点才到家，累坏了。肯定是因为这个
because I got home at 6 this morning, exhausted. That must be it.

125
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,917
我理解，可你父母没说什么？
I understand, but don't your parents say anything ?

126
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,626
还有关于授课薪水的事...
About paying for the lessons too...

127
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:40,334
朱莉亚，毛里齐奥的父母死于一场空难
Giulia, Maurizio lost his parents in a plane crash,

128
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:43,542
所以你能想像他的情况有多糟
so you can imagine how serious the situation is,

129
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,084
这可怜的家伙必须在周末去端盘子才能付得出学费
the poor guy has to serve tables at the weekend to pay for his lessons,

130
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,751
告诉她
tell her.

131
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:52,001
我必须在周末端盘子
I have to serve tables at the weekend.

132
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:55,334
可他正计划付钱...告诉她
But he's planning to pay... Tell her.

133
00:09:55,542 --> 00:09:57,667
我正计划付钱
I'm planning to pay.

134
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,792
总之，我之前想表达的意思是
Anyway, what I was trying to say earlier

135
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,251
这项研究的确是个了不起的成功
was the research really was a great success.

136
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:04,542
委员会立马就看出了
The commission saw right away

137
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:07,751
我发明的这个算法的革命性影响
the revolutionary impact of this algorithm

138
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:12,584
而它将会引发，我敢保证，一次科学巨震
that I invented and that will lead, I'm sure, to a scientific earthquake.

139
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,084
教授，吃饭时别说这些！
Prof, not at the table !

140
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:17,751
整个下午都有这种压抑的感觉
This agony has been going on in the background all afternoon,

141
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,251
合同、科研、巨震，呃！
the contract, the scientific research, the earthquake, eh !

142
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,042
对，没错，彼得罗，所有我们眼前的难题，你也是！
Yes, really, Pietro, with all the problems we have, you as well !

143
00:10:30,834 --> 00:10:34,417
所以，根据薛定谔方程式
So, according to Schrodinger's equation,

144
00:10:34,626 --> 00:10:38,917
我们可以毫无疑问地说这些粒子...
we can say without any doubt that the particles...

145
00:10:39,126 --> 00:10:42,459
- 彼得罗，我得跟你谈谈   - 教授，我正考试呢...
- Pietro, I have to speak to you.   - Professor, I'm doing an exam...

146
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:45,251
我知道这个学生的情况。你还没准备好，很明显
I know what this student's like. You're not ready, obviously,

147
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:46,626
下学期再来吧
come back next session.

148
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:49,459
教授，我已经回答了所有的问题，我需要这次考试
Professor, I've answered all the questions, I need this exam.

149
00:10:49,626 --> 00:10:52,542
我们家开了一间药店！我怎么跟我父亲说？
My family has a pharmacy ! What can I tell my father ?

150
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,626
我给你28分，别再碍我的事，行吗？
28 out of 30, to stop you breaking my balls ! All right ?

151
00:10:57,584 --> 00:11:00,251
- 什么事？   - 我有两条消息给你
- What is it ?   - I've two bits of news for you,

152
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,292
一条是坏消息，另一条更糟
one is bad and the other is really shit,

153
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:06,792
因为委员会已经决定只对五项请求中的一项进行资助
because the commission has agreed to only one of the five requests

154
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,084
财政削减造成的
for financing because of the cutbacks.

155
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:12,501
这真是一场悲剧，尤其是对我的同事们，因为...
This is a tragedy, especially for my colleagues, because...

156
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:17,001
不，是你没得到。真正糟糕的消息是贾科梅蒂得到了
No, you don't get it, the really shit news is Giacometti got it.

157
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:20,084
贾科梅蒂得到了？
Giacometti got it ?

158
00:11:20,292 --> 00:11:23,417
可我的研究有拿诺贝尔奖的希望！贾科梅蒂？
But my research could be Nobel material ! Giacometti ?

159
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:25,209
听着，彼得罗
Listen, Pietro,

160
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:28,376
他们根本就不理解你的研究，因为太深奥了
they understood nothing about your research because it's too difficult !

161
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,292
我同样也不理解！
I didn't understand anything about it either !

162
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,917
塞塔教授看上去像个傻瓜
Professor Seta looked like a fool,

163
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:36,167
因为他们不停地问啊问啊问那些我没法回答的问题
because they were asking and asking and asking things I couldn't answer.

164
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:38,251
教授，我们一起签的研究协议！
Professor, we both signed the research !

165
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:40,959
求你，你不能回避这些问题！
You can't not answer the questions, please !

166
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,417
你不明白！这是个政治问题
You don't understand ! It's a political problem.

167
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:47,001
你和那些极端天主教徒站在一起的决定
Your decision to line up with the Catholic extremists

168
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:50,001
是错的，而且毫无远见
was a mistake and very shortsighted.

169
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,542
教授，是你说你那个来自阿韦利诺的朋友笑了...
Professor, it was you who said your friend from Avellino had smiled...

170
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,001
- 与我无关   - 他是个老托洛茨基分子
- It was nothing to do with me.   - He's an old Trotskyite

171
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:00,667
来自现属左翼自由联盟阵营中的共产党！
from the Communist Party who's in Sinistra e Libertà now !

172
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:02,917
我有尝试和他交谈
I even tried speaking to him,

173
00:12:03,126 --> 00:12:06,542
我说，我们有共同的普适价值观
I said, we have some Catholic values in common,

174
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,292
你知道他说什么吗？滚开！所以我就说，如果你让我滚开
you know what he said ? Fuck off ! So I said, if you say fuck off,

175
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:15,376
那你为什么不滚，你这个老王八！接下来事情就有点失控了
Then why don't you fuck off, you old bugger ! And then things got a bit out of control.

176
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:19,626
教授，这是不是说不会有长期合同了？
Professor, does this mean no long-term contract ?

177
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:22,417
他们连一年的合同都不会给你！
They won't even give you a year's contract !

178
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:25,501
每月那500欧元对我很重要，教授！
Those 500 euros a month kept me going Professor !

179
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,917
我已经37岁了，现在我还能开始做什么呢？
I'm 37, what can I start doing now ?

180
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,792
稍等，我接下电话
Wait, I need to answer this.

181
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,667
喂，你好，我是马尔凯托！
Yes, hello, Marchetto !

182
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,459
怎么说呢？我们开始了一项未知的...
What can I say ? We proceed into the unknown...

183
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:41,126
我想问你来着，你把船的泊位订好了吗？
I wanted to ask you, did you book the mooring for the boat ?

184
00:12:41,334 --> 00:12:45,459
安乔莱托真把事情搞砸了。你知道这傻缺干了什么事吗？
Angioletto really messed things up. Do you know what the dickhead did ?

185
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:42,209
- 彼得罗，你在卫生间里吗？   - 对
- Pietro, you in the bathroom ?   - Yes.

186
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:46,042
- 还要很久吗？   - 不，我好了。马上出来
- You going to be long ?   - No, I'm finished. Coming.

187
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:49,292
- 你讲话怪怪的   - 没，没有
- You sound strange.   - No, no.

188
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:55,626
- 你哭了？   - 没，没有
- Have you been crying ?   - No, no,

189
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,751
我估计是你肥皂的PH值不适合...
it's the PH of this soap of yours, I think...

190
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:02,292
彼得罗，别像个傻瓜，是你工作上出了什么问题吗？
Pietro, don't be an asshole, has something happened at work ?

191
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:05,709
不，不是...我原想和你谈一下...
No, no... I wanted to talk to you for a minute...

192
00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:09,167
你的合同出问题了？
Are there problems with your contract ?

193
00:14:09,376 --> 00:14:12,667
没有。只不过新合同上有一点点...
No. It's just that the new contract has kind of...

194
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,959
他们给没给你签新合同？
Did they give you a new contract or not ?

195
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,292
如果你只想要简单的回答有或没有...
If you want a simple yes or no...

196
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:19,709
- 有或没有？   - 有！
- Yes or no ?   - Yes!

197
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,959
有，是一份全日制合同
Yes, and a full-time contract.

198
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:27,667
我本想给你个惊喜，可被你毁了。不过那又如何？
I wanted to surprise you, but you spoiled it. But so what ?

199
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:35,126
那他们有没有告诉你每月付你多少钱？
Did they tell you what they'll pay you a month ?

200
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:38,209
嗯，这不是你想要多少就多少的。。。
Well, that's not something you ask...

201
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:40,251
对，当然，别担心...
No, of course, don't worry about it...

202
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:44,001
别期望太高，他们又不是让我当院长
Don't expect too much, it's not like they made me rector.

203
00:14:45,001 --> 00:14:47,417
好吧，了解，不过至少有1500欧元，是吗？别吊我胃口！
All right, I get it, but at least 1,500, no ? For fuck's sake !

204
00:14:47,626 --> 00:14:49,834
当然，可能还再多点
Sure, maybe a little bit more.

205
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:52,126
- 2000？   - 差不多
- 2,000 ?   - Sure.

206
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,084
等等，1500还是2000？
Hang on, 1,500 or 2,000 ?

207
00:14:55,376 --> 00:14:58,917
按加权平均来算，差不多1800欧元
Do a weighted mean, kind of 1,800.

208
00:14:59,126 --> 00:15:01,542
好吧，这样的话我们就能付得起电梯费了
All right, this way we can pay the elevator.

209
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:02,626
对，没错
Yeah, sure.

210
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,167
- 而且我们能雇得起真正的律师了   - 没错
- Then we'll hire a real lawyer.   - Sure.

211
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:07,792
到那天，再买台洗碗机
And while we're at it, a dishwasher.

212
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:10,834
好的，不过我们不能重蹈别人的覆辙
Yeah, but let's not make that classic mistake people make,

213
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:12,751
有些人一拿到钱
where as soon as they get some money,

214
00:15:13,001 --> 00:15:16,542
- 就花得精光   - 是的。我们到那边去
- they spend it.   - Sure. Let's go through there.

215
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:20,626
去那边？都9点了，我约了乔吉奥和马蒂亚
Through there ? It's 9, I've got to meet Giorgio and Mattia.

216
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,167
一会再去吧！
So go later !

217
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:25,167
不，这次肾上腺素的下降使我体内缺乏钾离子...
No, this drop in adrenaline has lowered my potassium...

218
00:15:25,376 --> 00:15:27,209
稍后你可以来份香蕉奶昔
You can make a banana shake after.

219
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:30,292
之后我会逐渐衰弱，出现大规模脱盐...
Then I'll go in asthenia, major saline deficiency...

220
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:33,292
- 彼得罗，你在耍我！   - 我来了！
- Pietro, you're breaking my balls !   - I'm coming.

221
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:36,792
不过，坦白说，别对表现有过多期望
But, hands up, don't expect too much of a performance

222
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:41,084
只是纯粹庆祝一下，做不了什么花样！
which is going to be purely celebratory, no fancy acrobatics !

223
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:42,334
我能跟你说什么呢？
What can I tell you ?

224
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:45,501
根据你说的情况，好像挺复杂的
From what you say, it sounds really complicated.

225
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,751
这差不多就是海勒里安悖论
I'd almost say a Hellerian paradox.

226
00:15:48,001 --> 00:15:51,501
乔吉奥，我失业了，身无分文，你却说什么海勒里安？
Giorgio, I'm jobless, penniless and you say it's Hellerian ?

227
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,459
- 这就是场悲剧！   - 听着
- It's a tragedy !   - Look,

228
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,584
它本身并没有多严重
in itself it doesn't have too high a gravity index.

229
00:15:57,001 --> 00:16:01,251
是你说谎把事情搞复杂了，让你陷入被动
It's the lying which complicates it, given your domestic situation.

230
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,084
我知道，马蒂亚，不过在奉献了七年之后
I know, Mattia, but after seven years of sacrifices,

231
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:06,167
- 让我怎么能告诉她实情呢？   - 是吗？
- how could I tell her the truth ?   - Yes ?

232
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,667
- 满足她   - 干嘛提到长期合同？
- Fill her up.   - Why mention a long-term contract ?

233
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:11,292
好吧，顺嘴溜出来的
Well, that bullshit just slipped out.

234
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,834
各位，我还有项法院指令要去付费，他们准备拿走我的东西做抵押
Guys, I have a court order to pay, they're going to seize my things,

235
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,292
家里紧张到了极点...
and it's all really stressful at home...

236
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:20,792
我懂，不过空悲切有什么用
I know, but moaning won't help.

237
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:37,001
各位，这太可悲了！我意思是，看看你们自己！
Guys, this is pathetic ! I mean, look at yourselves !

238
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:39,626
我可不想走你们这条路！
I don't want to end up like you !

239
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,126
国际知名的拉丁学者在一个加油站里
Internationally acclaimed Latin scholars standing in a gas station

240
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,251
为了挣钱给一个锡兰人打工
working for a Singhalese guy who pays you cash.

241
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:47,251
彼得罗，注意你说阿里·汗先生的言辞
Pietro, watch what you say about Mister Ali Khan,

242
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,917
他在我们非常困难的时候给了我们信心
who had faith in us at a very difficult moment.

243
00:16:50,126 --> 00:16:53,709
他是个可敬的人，有着不容质疑的美德和慷慨大度...
He's a lovely man, of undoubted morality and generosity...

244
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:56,459
喂，毛里齐奥！我花钱就是让你站那聊天来着？
Oi ! Do I pay you to stand there and chat ?

245
00:16:56,667 --> 00:17:00,167
抱歉，阿里·汗先生。这位先生马上就走
Sorry, Mr. Ali Khan. The gentleman is leaving.

246
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:02,126
快走，不然他生起气来有得搞
Go, or he'll be pissed and rightly so.

247
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:03,626
你怎么说锡兰语？
You speak Singhalese ?

248
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:06,376
好吧，要是你懂梵文，两者差不了多少
Well, if you know Sanskrit, it all falls into place.

249
00:17:06,584 --> 00:17:09,376
- 205欧元   - 给你
- 205 euros.   - There you go.

250
00:17:09,584 --> 00:17:11,542
- 谢谢你   - 谢谢，晚安
- Thank you.   - Thank you. Good night.

251
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:14,417
- 那是毛利齐奥？   - 谁？
- Was that Maurizio ?   - Who ?

252
00:17:14,626 --> 00:17:16,501
- 他刚刚付了多少钱？   - 205欧元
- What did he just pay ?   - 205 euros.

253
00:17:16,751 --> 00:17:17,751
两...
Two...

254
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,376
安全帽，马蒂亚，安全帽！
The helmet, Mattia, the helmet !

255
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:37,376
毛里齐奥！毛里齐奥！
Maurizio ! Maurizio !

256
00:17:48,292 --> 00:17:50,001
该死的！
Fucking hell

257
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,251
教授！你在干嘛...？
Professor ! What are you doing...?

258
00:18:19,459 --> 00:18:21,376
- 这个时候还出来骑车？   - 毛里齐奥
- Out on a bike at this hour ?   - Maurizio,

259
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:25,917
马上靠边，因为我们得谈谈！
pull over right now because you and I have to speak !

260
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:28,126
这是怎么回事？我跟每个人都说你很穷
What's going on ? I've been telling everyone you're poor

261
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,001
而你却在开着宇宙飞船兜风？
and you're driving around in a spaceship ?

262
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:33,709
- 我记得你是个服务生？   - 对，不过我不常干
- I thought you were a waiter ?   - Yeah, I don't do it very often.

263
00:18:34,001 --> 00:18:35,751
我父亲有家餐饮公司
My father's got a catering company.

264
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,501
你父亲？我记得你父亲已经去世了！
Your father ? I thought your father was dead !

265
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:42,584
没！我们吵了一架，我说：“就我而言，你已经死了”
No ! We argued and I said, "As far as I'm concerned, you're dead."

266
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,542
- 但后来我们...   - 好吧，但是这有很大的区别！
- But then we made up...   - OK, but there's a big difference !

267
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,751
毛里齐奥，马上靠边
Maurizio, pull over now

268
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,209
把欠我的钱给我，因为我看见你花200欧元加了汽油
and give me what you owe me, because I saw you pay 200 euros for gas,

269
00:18:51,417 --> 00:18:54,417
- 我看见你了！   - 我不能停下，不然我就上不了名单
- I saw you !   - I can't, I'll miss the guest list.

270
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:57,001
- 什么？   - 在市中心大厅，1点钟就要关门
- What ?   - At Central, it closes at one.

271
00:18:57,126 --> 00:18:58,709
已经很晚了，我必须过去
It's late, I need to go.

272
00:18:59,001 --> 00:19:01,376
- 就这样，教授！我们走了！   - 毛里齐奥！
- Great, Professor ! On you go !   - Maurizio !

273
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:05,459
过来！毛里齐奥！毛里齐奥！
Come here ! Maurizio ! Maurizio !

274
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,834
- 毛里齐奥！   - 太好了，教授！你也来了！
- Maurizio !   - Great, Professor ! Here as well !

275
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,751
这顶安全帽挺配你的！款式真好！
That helmet suits you ! What style !

276
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:55,042
你下来，我们得谈谈！下来！
Get down here, we need to speak ! Get down !

277
00:19:55,209 --> 00:19:57,376
教授，一点零钱别那么大惊小怪
Professor, what a fuss over some loose change.

278
00:19:57,584 --> 00:19:59,584
我现在就给你，让你高兴一下
I'll give you it now just to keep you happy.

279
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:02,001
- 多少钱？   - 500欧元
- How much is it ?   - 500 euros.

280
00:20:02,126 --> 00:20:04,709
加上30欧元跟过来的费用，这是必须的
Plus 30 euros to get in here, which has to be added.

281
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,084
不行，我还得买单呢
I can't, I have to pay for my table.

282
00:20:07,417 --> 00:20:11,501
- 我只能给你一半   - 不行！一半不行，给我全额
- I can give you half.   - No ! Not half, give me all of it.

283
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:15,459
好吧，我周三给全。可以吧，教授！
All right, I'll give you all of it on Wednesday. Great, Professor !

284
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:19,126
好吧。给我一半。先给一半，另一半周三给
All right. Give me half. Give me half and the rest on Wednesday.

285
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:23,501
而且我跟你说，你是个非常不诚实的人
And let me tell you, you're a profoundly dishonest person,

286
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:26,001
你很粗鲁，而且你是个大骗子！
you're rude, and you're a big liar!

287
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,126
你想毁了我这个晚上？放松一下吧
You want to ruin my night ? Relax a minute,

288
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:31,209
看你这样子，汗都湿透了
you're a mess, you're all sweaty.

289
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:34,917
我浑身是汗！这鬼地方像地狱一样，足足有40度
I'm sweaty ! This place is hellish, with a 40 degrees temperature range,

290
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:39,584
- 我已经要受不了了   - 没错，把这个喝了吧
- and I am really, really jumpy.   - Exactly, so drink this.

291
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:42,501
- 这是什么？   - 这是什么？这是鸡尾酒！
- What is it ?   - What is it ? It's a cocktail !

292
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:45,626
好吧，我只是太渴了
All right, just because I'm really thirsty.

293
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:47,501
这算我的。要100欧元呢
It's on me. It costs 100 euros.

294
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:50,667
这可以消除你的顾虑，你所有的担心
It'll get rid of all your worries, all your concerns,

295
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:51,834
算我的
it's on me.

296
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:57,709
这个很淡，而且有点水果味...
It's quite light and it's a bit fruity...

297
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:04,001
- 不好意思，这为什么要100欧元？   - 没错，教授！
- Sorry, why does it cost 100 euros ?   - Yeah, Professor !

298
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,042
抱歉，你在干什么？
I'm sorry, what are you doing ?

299
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:24,209
我在小便！想睡觉就到外面去
I'm peeing ! Go outside if you want to collapse.

300
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,376
- 毛里齐奥！   - 好极了，教授！你去哪了？
- Maurizio !   - Great, Professor ! Where were you ?

301
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:41,751
- 那是什么？你让我吸毒了？   - 再来一杯振作一下？
- What was that ? Did you drug me ?   - Have another one to pick you up !

302
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,626
毛里齐奥，你真阴险！你差点杀了我！
Maurizio, you're dangerous ! You could have killed me !

303
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,251
杀你！这可是顶级货
Kill you ! That's top-quality stuff.

304
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,917
顶级？这就是垃圾合成品
Quality ? It's synthetic rubbish,

305
00:21:51,126 --> 00:21:52,751
只是麻黄素合剂！
some ephedrine concoction !

306
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:58,001
这杯垃圾里有两片药，每片50欧元！
That rubbish contained two pills that cost 50 euros each !

307
00:21:58,376 --> 00:22:02,126
毛里齐奥，我是个好人，可我要是陷进去... 50欧元？
Maurizio, I'm a nice guy, but if I lose it... 50 euros ?

308
00:22:02,834 --> 00:22:07,126
这是欺诈！做一片这种药根本要不了2欧元
That's fraud ! Making one of those can't cost more than two euros.

309
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:11,292
好吧，下堂课，教我们怎么做它，我们弄它1公斤！
Well, next lesson, teach us how to make it and we'll make a kilo!

310
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,584
好极了，教授！

00:23:43,376 --> 00:23:46,959
- 你脸上   - 哦，没什么，只是画了个哨子
- On your face.   - Oh no nothing it's just a click.

335
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:39,709
没什么，嗯，因为五年前你也参与了项目的启动，我想...
No, well, because you were there at the start 5 years ago, I thought...

336
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,751
现在我在从事别的
Now I'm doing something else.

337
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:47,334
听着，阿尔贝托，要是我跟你说C11H15NO2，你怎么讲？
Listen, Alberto, if I said to you C11 H15 N O2, what would you say ?

338
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:51,751
5分钟时间意味着300秒，我还得撒尿
5 minutes' break means 300 seconds and I need to pee.

339
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:56,792
- 要不了多久。C11H15NO2   - 是塞塔教授发给你的？
- It won't take long. C11 H15 N O2.   - Did Professor Seta send you ?

340
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:00,084
告诉他我不会在任何东西上面签字！再也不会！
Tell him I won't put my name to anything ! Never again !

341
00:25:00,251 --> 00:25:03,834
这和塞塔一点关系也没有。C11H15NO2
It's nothing to do with Seta. C11 H15 N O2.

342
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:08,126
好吧，这是作用于血清素系统的精神类药物
All right, it's a psychotropic that acts on the serotonergic system.

343
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:13,001
- 还有呢？   - 还有？什么？还有就是它是非法的！
- And ?   - And ? What ? And it's illegal !

344
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:15,501
要是我替你把它弄成合法的呢？
What if I make it legal for you ?

345
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:20,709
阿尔贝托，阿尔贝托，等等！
Alberto, Alberto, wait !

346
00:25:22,709 --> 00:25:28,209
好的，好的。抱歉，抱歉，抱歉。真的...我不了解你
Yes, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Really... I don't understand you.

347
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:31,751
不，彼得罗！你不能在这儿。我没兴趣，告诉你...
No, Pietro ! You can't be in here. I'm not interested, I told you...

348
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:36,084
阿尔贝托，阿尔贝托，他们拒绝资助我的研究
Alberto, Alberto, they refused to fund my research.

349
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:39,459
我已经快要成功了，算法是可行的
I'd almost finished, the algorithm was working.

350
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:42,542
可是弄出一个你不能利用的理论制剂公式有什么用呢？
But why have a theoretical molecule program if you can't use it ?

351
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:45,626
没错！所以你就想到去弄一种精神类药物！
Sure ! So you thought, I'll theorize a psychotropic one !

352
00:25:45,834 --> 00:25:48,626
阿尔贝托，我们比别人聪明得多
Alberto, we're more intelligent than the others.

353
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:51,626
要是我们一起合作就能挣很多钱！
If we worked together we could made a pile of money !

354
00:25:51,834 --> 00:25:55,334
彼得罗，最多六个月我就会成为这里的服务生
Pietro, maximum six months I'll be working as a waiter here.

355
00:25:55,542 --> 00:25:59,834
小费，一周工作六天，一个月700欧元！你明白吗？
Tips, one clay off a week and 700 euros a month ! Do you get it ?

356
00:26:00,084 --> 00:26:02,959
我能帮你在半个小时里挣到700欧元
I'll help you earn 700 euros in half an hour.

357
00:26:08,292 --> 00:26:11,626
你洗盘子的时候好好想一想吧。我出去了
While you're washing the plates, think about it. I'll be outside.

358
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:20,209
我在洗这些东西，我在洗这些东西！去你的！
I'm washing them, I'm washing them ! Fuck off !

359
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:31,292
听着，我会把我所有处方级的讲义分享给你
Look, I'll spare you all the lectures on the ethical level,

360
00:26:31,501 --> 00:26:34,209
因为当我被赶出大学的时候我就放弃了伦理
because I abandoned ethics when they kicked me out of university.

361
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:37,751
我开始变得现实。我不想去监狱！
I'm being practical. I don't want to go to jail !

362
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,376
阿尔贝托，罪犯才去监狱，你和我是罪犯吗？
Alberto, criminals go to jail, are you and I criminals ?

363
00:26:41,584 --> 00:26:45,251
根据我的算法得到的制剂不在政府的清单上
With the algorithm I make a molecule that's not on the Ministry list,

364
00:26:45,459 --> 00:26:46,542
你来生产
and you produce it.

365
00:26:46,751 --> 00:26:50,584
我们一起做出最好的药剂，而且完全合法
Together we make the best substance ever and we do it all legally.

366
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:55,042
我为什么要这么做？
Why would I do something like that ?

367
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:58,959
因为你是一名大学教授，你不该受到这种待遇
Because you're a university professor and you don't deserve this life.

368
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:02,959
- 你脸上是什么？   - 一个鸡巴剩下的部分
- What's that on your face ?   - What's left of a dick.

369
00:27:03,126 --> 00:27:07,126
这是不可擦的笔... 算了，我们别分心
These indelible pens that... All right, let's not get distracted.

370
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,542
听着，我们得组建一个帮派
Listen, we're going to form a gang.

371
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:11,167
- 帮派？   - 帮派
- A gang ?   - A gang.

372
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:16,001
干非法销售？不行，没人会信我们，不！
Of pushers ? We can't, we wouldn't be credible, no !

373
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:18,917
不行，没人相信我们
No, we're not credible.

374
00:27:21,251 --> 00:27:25,126
但我们能够变得可信，而且我已经找到了合适人选...
But we could become credible and I've got the right person...

375
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:28,626
...于是我为了不出卖朋友而蹲了两年监狱
...So I did two years' prison so as not to grass a friend.

376
00:27:28,834 --> 00:27:34,751
出来后就跟着我叔叔干，直到他死于三个月前...
I got out, went to work with my uncle until he died three months ago...

377
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:37,001
- 啊，抱歉   - 没事，他没遭受痛苦
- Ah, I'm sorry.   - No, he didn't suffer,

378
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:40,334
刀子捅得非常准，就在颈动脉这儿
they knifed him really accurately, here on the carotid.

379
00:27:40,542 --> 00:27:44,001
下手的那家伙从事的是某种老式在线扑克游戏的行当
And the guy that did it was right, some old online poker business.

380
00:27:44,167 --> 00:27:47,542
当事情一团糟的时候，他的子女为遗嘱吵个不休
That's when it got messy, his children fighting over the will,

381
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:53,834
在法律层面上为了遗产争得很激烈，家家如此
a bitter legal quarrel over the inheritance, families are like that.

382
00:27:54,084 --> 00:27:57,001
- 为了钱而争吵   - 抱歉，你刚才说什么？
- An argument about money.   - Sorry, what did you say ?

383
00:27:57,167 --> 00:28:01,001
子女们开始争吵，都是和钱有关
The children started fighting, it always happens with money.

384
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:06,001
- 你刚才说“法律层面上争得很激烈”   - 是吗？我也不知道是什么意思
- You said "bitter legal quarrel".   - Me ? I don't know what that means.

385
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:09,251
- 你可是研究生   - 我不是研究生
- You're a graduate.   - I'm not a graduate.

386
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,292
我很清楚。我不要研究生
I was clear. I don't take graduates.

387
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:14,126
我不是！我在中学就因为卖毒品被开除了
I'm not ! I got kicked out of middle school for selling dope.

388
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:17,167
- 你让人无法相信   - 那我干嘛会在这儿？
- You can't be trusted.   - Why would I be here, then ?

389
00:28:17,376 --> 00:28:20,751
- 你是这周第三位   - 我不是研究生！
- You're the third this week.   - I'm not a graduate!

390
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:27,376
好吧，我是，但我为这种幼稚的错误感到遗憾
All right, I am, but it was a youthful mistake that I regret.

391
00:28:27,584 --> 00:28:30,334
我请求放弃我的学历
I'm asking to renounce my academic qualifications.

392
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,126
两周内，我会回到小学学历
In two weeks, I'll be back to grade 5 level.

393
00:28:33,334 --> 00:28:35,626
我可以把所有论文给你看
I can show you all the paperwork.

394
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:39,001
- 你在这做事就不会干净了   - 所以我来了
- You get your hands dirty here.   - That's why I'm here.

395
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:42,501
我不需要一个只在那看书的人。明白吗？
I don't need people who are always reading. Is that clear ?

396
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:46,626
- 你看你是个好孩子   - 不！别叫我好孩子！
- You can see you're a good kid.   - No ! Don't call me a good kid !

397
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:48,459
我可是很危险的
I'm really very dangerous,

398
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:52,001
我时不时会做出一些无法预料的事
from one moment to another I might do something unexpected...

399
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,376
好。那么？
Yes. Well ?

402
00:28:59,126 --> 00:29:02,792
那张票据很重要，是吗？我很抱歉
That was an important bill, wasn't it ? I'm really sorry,

403
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:07,001
我不知道刚才脑子怎么想的。这就是那张票据
I don't know what came over me. It was a bill,

404
00:29:07,167 --> 00:29:10,167
不过重要的是数字，你可以认得出来...
but the important thing is the number, you can trace it...

405
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,959
把PDF文件发给我重新打印一份。我很抱歉
Send me the PDF and I'll reprint it. I'm very sorry.

406
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,792
你在干什么？你明白你不适合干这事
What are you doing ? You can see you're not cut out for it.

407
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:18,626
我知道。不过我正在度过一个难关
I know. But I'm going through a difficult period.

408
00:29:18,834 --> 00:29:21,626
听着，孩子，积累点经验
Listen, kid, get a bit of experience,

409
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:25,834
找点麻烦，混迹街头，然后可以回来
get into trouble, live on the street, and then maybe come back.

410
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:27,542

415

安德里亚会改变我们

416
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,209
没有哪一类人性是他不知道或在某种程度上模仿不了的
There's no human category he doesn't know and can't emulate in some way.

417
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:44,959
他会帮我们融入犯罪的世界
He'll fit us into the world of crime.

418
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:47,417
那我们怎么进行销售呢？
What will we do about sales ?

419
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:49,084
我们需要擅长夜间活动的人
We need someone who's good at night.

420
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:52,792
我有两个人选，他们干了多年的夜活
I've got two guys, they've been night people for years.

421
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:56,042
他们对周围的道路也很熟悉
They know their way round the street as well,

422
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:59,792
我是说，什么都见识过的人，嗯！相信我
I mean, people who have seen it all, eh ! Trust me.

423
00:30:00,501 --> 00:30:04,084
- 需要什么？   - 你能帮我检查下轮胎吗？
- Yes ?   - Can you check my tires ?

424
00:30:04,251 --> 00:30:09,292
检查下我的轮胎...尽管有点绕，我始终觉得
Check my tires... Despite the racket, I've always found it fascinating

425
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:13,126
盎格鲁撒克逊人说出来的本地方言让人陶醉
when the Anglo-Saxon contaminates the vernacular.

426
00:30:13,334 --> 00:30:15,209
你他妈在说什么？
What the fuck are you saying ?

427
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:19,667
很明显，这只会发生在文盲身上...
Obviously, this occurs in barely literate environments...

428
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:21,959
我真想把他脑袋砸碎
I'm going to crack his skull.

429

马蒂亚，马蒂亚，这位强壮的男士好像对我充满了敌意
Mattia, Mattia, the brawny gentleman seems to me to be hostile.

I'd like to remind you that even the threat of violence is a crime...

431

439
00:31:00,209 --> 00:31:02,334
抱歉，先生...
Sorry, sir, I got caught up...

<i>他很穷，11年的短期合同，跟他父母住在一起</i>
<i>He's poor, 11 years of short-term contracts, lives with his parents.</i>

- Sir, you not eating ?   - No, no.

442
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,959
天太热了，而且我担心体重会增加
It's too hot and I'm scared of putting on weight.

443

当我年轻的时候他们觉得我肚子里有毛病
When I was a teenager they thought I might have celiac disease,

00:31:20,167 --> 00:31:24,042
- 直到医生决定...   - 好吧，我知道了

445
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,209
没事，真的，真的，我很好

这份是加了炒蛋的

你老婆在里面加了洋葱？

448
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:38,501
好吧，不是对她无礼，也许我可以破下例
Well, not to be rude to her, maybe I can make an exception.

449
00:31:39,126 --> 00:31:40,792
我们干嘛要用到考古学家？
Why do we need an archeologist ?

450
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:43,084
我们需要阿图罗开卡车
We need Arturo for the truck.

451
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:44,792
卡车？
The truck ?

452
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:48,084
阿图罗有一辆考古部门的车可以开

455
00:31:54,334 --> 00:31:58,376
警察不会阻拦考古部门的卡车
The police won't stop an Archeology Department truck.

456
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:02,501
没错。那财务方面呢？
Of course. What about all the financial part ?

457
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:05,001
我在考虑马迪尼蒂。管理经济学专业
I was thinking of Martinetti. Management economics.

458
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,959
- 马迪尼蒂在挪威呢   - 他在奥斯陆拿到教师资格了？
- Martinetti's in Norway.   - He got the teaching post in Oslo ?

459
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,084
没，他在渔船上
No, he's on the fishing boats,

460
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:13,459
在北极圈一待就是六个月，整个鳕鱼季
six months in the Arctic Circle, the whole cod season.

很好！
Good!

462
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:20,626
还有波内利。为什么不，动态微观经济学专业，不行吗？
There's Bonelli. Why not, dynamic microeconomics, no ?

463
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:24,584
- 不，波内利做事从不考虑后果   - 那是过去式了！他现在好多了
- No, Bonelli's a loose cannon.   - Long ago ! He's better now.

464
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:29,376
他正在做经济学理论研究而且搞得不错
He's doing important economic-math research and it's going pretty well.

465
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,501
- 两千   - 亮牌
- 2,000.   - I'll see you.

466
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:38,334
我也亮
Me too.

467
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:45,459
好了，各位，这都是需要数学的，所以别抱怨
Now, guys, this is all just math, so don't complain.

468
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:50,292
- 一对   - 三个头
- Two pairs.   - Three of a kind.

469
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,376
- 同花顺   - 三个头？
- Straight flush.   - Three of a kind ?

470
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:56,542
两张A也想赢两千，你真能诈啊！
2,000 with two aces, what kind of bluff is that ?

471
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:00,126
什么诈？这是数学。是不是有52张牌？
What bluff ? This is math. There are 52 cards ?

472
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:03,542
那么就有52个阶乘因子。除以52
So there are 52 factorial divisions. divided by 52,

473
00:33:03,751 --> 00:33:08,209
减去5的阶乘，再除以5的阶乘，就得到2698590
minus factorial 5, divided by factorial 5, which makes 2,698,590,

474
00:33:08,417 --> 00:33:13,126
好吧，我理解你的同花顺，不过三个头有点奇怪
all right. I understand your flush, but the three of a kind is strange.

475
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,959
巴尔托洛梅奥，如果这就是你不给钱的借口，那小心点
Bartolomeo, if this is an excuse not to pay, be careful.

476
00:33:16,126 --> 00:33:16,917
当然不会
Of course not.

477
00:33:17,084 --> 00:33:20,209
可要是我说三个头有点奇怪，就是因为确实奇怪
But if I say the three of a kind is strange, it's because it is.

478
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:21,751
你他妈在说什么？
What the fuck are you saying ?

479
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:24,084
抱歉，你是学推论统计学的？
Excuse me, do you do inferential statistics ?

480
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:28,126
随机变数？计算概率？
Random variables ? Calculating probability ?

481
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,417
我可不这么认为
I don't really think so.

482
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,334
- 算了，总共多少？   - 七千
- Anyway, what's the total ?   - 7,000.

483
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:43,751
七千。我全付了。尽管我还是保持怀疑...
7,000. I'll pay it all. Though I still have my doubts...

484
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:52,792
不过我想说：我们再多玩一局，赢的人全拿走？
But let me say this: let's play one more hand, winner takes all ?

485
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:56,584
巴尔托洛梅奥，在这个夜晚变味之前把钱付清！
Bartolomeo, pay up before the evening turns sour !

486
00:33:56,792 --> 00:33:58,959
你直接说不行就是了
You could just say no.

487
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:04,209
我没有现金，我可以给你远期支票
I haven't got cash, I'll give you a post-dated check.

488
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,167
- 最好是现金   - 现金最好，好
- Cash is better.   - Cash is better, yes.

489
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:26,084
哦，你太过分了！
Oh, you're overdoing it !

490
00:34:28,959 --> 00:34:32,584
巴尔托洛梅奥！把钱给我们！
Bartolomeo ! Give us the money !

491
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:37,751
- 宝贝，你又干了些什么？   - 别生气
- Baby, what have you done now ?   - Don't be angry with me.

492
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:43,001
你老爸，恕我直言，连反话都听不懂！该死的！
Your father, with all due respect, has no sense of irony ! Fuck !

493
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:47,667
我们只是在玩牌...然后他有点疯了，疯了...
We were just playing cards... And at certain point, he went mad, mad...

494
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:33,584
彼得罗，你他妈在这干嘛？
Pietro, what the fuck are you doing here ?

495
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,126
- 进来   - 好的
- Get in.   - Yeah.

496
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:40,959
我该怎么跟你说呢？你不能在纸牌游戏里做运算
How can I tell you this ? You can't count the cards in poker.

497
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,417
碰上你这类人我就泡汤
It's people like you I screw.

498
00:35:44,626 --> 00:35:47,084
- 你好，弗兰提尼教授   - 波内利教授
- Hello, Professor Frantini.   - Professor Bonelli.

499
00:35:47,334 --> 00:35:49,667
好了我们该走了，要是他们上了保时捷我们就不好办了
Ok we should go now, because if they get the Porsches we'll be in the shit.

500
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:51,626
- 毫无疑问   - 对
- Undoubtedly.   - Yes.

501
00:35:52,126 --> 00:35:54,751
首先，我要感谢乔吉奥和马蒂亚
First of all, I'd like to thank Giorgio and Mattia

502
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,376
允许我们使用这个地方...
for letting us use this place...

503
00:35:57,584 --> 00:36:00,126
老天，各位！你买了个加油站？
Bloody hell, guys ! You bought a gas station ?

504
00:36:00,251 --> 00:36:02,126
没有，它是属于阿里·汗先生的
No, it belongs to Mister Ali Khan,

505
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:04,542
他提供仓库给他的工人住...
he uses the warehouses for his workers...

506
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:10,626
啊，这真得很有趣，因为我刚好跟一个姑娘住一起
Ah, this is very interesting, because I've just been living with a girl

507
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:13,626
她来自一个辛蒂马戏团家庭...关系挺难维持的
from a Sinti circus family... a difficult relationship,

508
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,834
因为他们非常传统
because they're very traditional,

509
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,959
把钱看得很重...
really attached to money...

510
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:20,501
打住，要是你想搬这儿来住
Stop there, if you're thinking of moving in here,

511
00:36:20,709 --> 00:36:22,167
我必须得阻止你，因为你不能这么做
I have to stop you because you can't.

512
00:36:22,376 --> 00:36:25,001
- “我必须得阻止你”！   - 你不能在这吸烟
- "I have to stop you" !   - You can't smoke here.

513
00:36:25,209 --> 00:36:27,751
- 这里到处是易燃品   - 马蒂亚！   - 绝对禁止
- It's all inflammable.   - Mattia ! - Absolutely forbidden.

514
00:36:27,959 --> 00:36:32,292
好吧，也许我们以后再研究住房问题
All right, maybe we can sort out the lodgings problem later.

515
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:36,751
你们可能在想为什么我把大家召集过来
You'll be wondering why I asked you all to come here.

516
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:39,417
我知道你想干什么
I know what you're up to.

517
00:36:39,626 --> 00:36:40,626
但说真的，彼得罗
But really, Pietro,

518
00:36:40,834 --> 00:36:43,376
在国会前由研究员组织的另一场
another demo by researchers on short-term contracts

519
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,584
为了短期合同的示威
outside Parliament,

520
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:47,876
- 我们在受到最后的打击后...   - 不，阿图罗
- after the last beating we got...   - No, Arturo.

521
00:36:48,126 --> 00:36:52,251
我喊你们来不是为了另一场反对削减研究经费的示威
I didn't ask you here for yet another demo against research cuts.

522
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:56,417
更确切地说我喊你们来是因为我不想再这么干了
I asked you here precisely because I don't want to do that again.

523
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,542
你们是周边最聪明的人
You're the greatest minds around

524
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:01,126
而你们却生活在社会的边缘！
and you're living on the fringes of society !

525
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:06,126
我们懂的唯一一件事就是做研究。而他们还不让我们做
The only thing we know how to do is study. And they won't let us.

526
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:11,834
现在，我已经找到一条路来拿到我们应得的东西
Well, I've worked out a way to get what we deserve.

527
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:16,667
- 再来一次示威！   - 不，阿图罗
- Back to the demo again !   - No, Arturo,

528
00:37:18,126 --> 00:37:22,501
我们成立一个帮派。我们在市场上推销一种新型毒品
We form a gang. We put a new drug on the market,

529
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:26,126
不是目前在俱乐部里的那种垃圾
not the shit they have in clubs now,

530
00:37:26,334 --> 00:37:29,876
而是从未有过的最好的产品！
but the best product there's ever been !

531
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:36,167
你们认为呢？
What do you think ?

532
00:37:39,126 --> 00:37:44,667
打扰一下，你是说我可能要两，两个晚上
Excuse me, are you saying that if I for two, two, nights,

533
00:37:44,876 --> 00:37:48,542
在那根容易被人发现的柱子后面睡在这么小的床垫上？
with a mattress this size went behind that pillar someone would notice ?

534
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:51,917
巴尔托洛梅奥，得了，我们正在这做一项重要的决定
Bartolomeo, come on, we're making an important decision here.

535
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:56,667
我全力支持你，这个为了我们自己的计划很吸引我
I'm with you 100%, this setting up for ourselves really appeals to me.

536
00:37:56,876 --> 00:38:01,667
你们都知道我接受的教育都是基于早期奥地利自由主义的
You all know my training was all based on early Austrian liberalism,

537
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:04,084
冯·哈耶克和冯·米塞斯...
Von Hayek e Von Mises...

538
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:08,501
那有个水箱！我在水箱后面谁能看得见？
There's the tank ! Who'd see me behind the tank ?

539
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:11,167
- 好啦，各位   - 抱歉，彼得罗...
- Come on, guys.   - Excuse me, Pietro...

540
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:13,501
只是想证实我的理解无误
just to check I've understood.

541
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:18,501
你是想组建一个从事非法销售的帮派，就像美剧里那样？
You want to set up a gang of pushers like in the American TV shows ?

542
00:38:18,709 --> 00:38:23,501
我不确定这个主意是否完全符合刑法
I'm not sure this initiative is entirely in line with the penal code.

543
00:38:23,709 --> 00:38:25,376
对，符合
Yes, it is,

544
00:38:25,584 --> 00:38:31,126
因为我已经研究出一种制剂符合意大利法律
because I've theorized a molecule that for Italian law is legal.

545
00:38:31,501 --> 00:38:36,626
现在先别管什么愚蠢的合法性了。我们一步步来
Never mind this silly legal stuff for now. Let's go step by step.

546
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:42,751
第一步。启动。巴尔托洛梅奥，我需要一份详细的财务计划
Phase 1. Start-up. Bartolomeo, I need a detailed financial plan,

547
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:45,626
我必须了解这样是不是能够发展得下去
I have to understand if this is economically sustainable.

548
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:47,876
成本、收入、利润，所有的东西
Costs, income, profit margins, everything.

549
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:51,626
首先，我们从笛卡尔模型开始...
To start with, we'll begin with a simple Cartesian model...

550
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:58,292
...在一套数学系统内，为了让事情简单
...within a math system that, to keep things simple,

551
00:38:58,501 --> 00:39:00,876
我们称之为“市场”
we'll call "the market".

552
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:03,876
在建立供需曲线之后
Having established the supply and demand curves,

553
00:39:04,126 --> 00:39:06,667
我们就拥有了去获得启动资金的基础
we have the basis on which to get start-up funds.

554
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:09,876
别摆出那堆臭脸，因为我们没什么好担心的
Don't make those faces because there's nothing to worry about.

555
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:12,334
发行股票要有必要的时间，我们知道
The issuing of shares takes the time it takes, we know that,

556
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:15,792
不过还有股权清盘以及/或者兑现
but there's the liquidation and/or cashing in of stock options,

557
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:18,959
我们有信用额度，我们有预开支票的可能性
we have credit lines, we have the possibility of pre-billing,

558
00:39:19,126 --> 00:39:23,001
我们能拿到贷款，提前拿到买断补偿金...
we can get a loan, an advance on our severance packages...

559
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:25,626
...再抵押...
...remortgaging...

560
00:39:26,917 --> 00:39:29,709
...一些个人存款...
...some personal savings...

561
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,542
从你们家里借钱...
loans from your families...

562
00:39:33,751 --> 00:39:35,126
没了
nothing.

563
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:39,376
好吧，我会带点钱过来
All right, I'll come up with something.

564
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:49,417
该死！
Fuck !

565
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:02,626
- 你疯了吗？   - 是我
- Are you mad ?   - It's me.

566
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,751
- 你在干什么？   - 我得见你
- What are you doing ?   - I needed to see you.

567
00:40:06,959 --> 00:40:10,292
- 怎么，你要钱？   - 不，不！好吧，就要一点儿
- What, you need money ?   - No, no ! Well, a little.

568
00:40:10,501 --> 00:40:14,126
- 救命！   - 嘘！你疯了吗？闭嘴！
- Help !   - Shhh ! Are you mad ? Shut up!

569
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:16,626
给我出去，巴尔托洛梅奥。我什么都不会给你的！
Get out of here, Bartolomeo. I'm giving you nothing !

570
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,209
你除了会输光。你怎么指望在纸牌游戏里做运算
You'd only lose it. You can't count the cards in poker.

571
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,834
先不说可以这种事实，而且也不止我一个人这么说
Apart from the fact you can, and it's not just me who says so,

572
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:24,626
不过现在都无关紧要了
but that's irrelevant now.

573
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:28,542
这次是为了一个与我大学同事有关的项目，实实在在的
It's for a project with my university colleagues, it's something concrete.

574
00:40:28,751 --> 00:40:31,792
你总是这么说。我知道你只对我的钱有兴趣
You always say that. I know you're only interested in me for my money.

575
00:40:32,001 --> 00:40:34,584
不是这样的！这太让我伤心了！
That's not true ! That's hurtful to me !

576
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,751
我正要和你一起做点什么，朝前看
I'm building something with you, looking ahead.

577
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:40,792
那就娶我吧！
So marry me !

578
00:40:43,292 --> 00:40:45,126
天啊，今晚你真漂亮
God, you're beautiful tonight.

579
00:40:48,334 --> 00:40:52,292
- 你真得愿意娶我？   - 再说吧，听着...
- You'll really marry me ?   - We'll see, listen...

580
00:40:52,501 --> 00:40:55,709
一万欧元现金，但得是小面额的
10,000 euros in cash, but small denomination notes,

581
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:58,792
不要那些500欧元面值的，大家不喜欢那种
not those 500-euro ones, people don't like them.

582
00:40:59,126 --> 00:41:04,376
<i>第二步。原材料。丁香酚，任何丁香制品里都能找到</i>
<i>Phase 2. Raw materials. Eugenol, you find it in anything made with cloves.</i>

583
00:41:04,584 --> 00:41:08,876
<i>我们需要不少。香波、空气清新剂、精油等等</i>
<i>We need a lot. Shampoo, air fresheners, essential oils.</i>

584
00:41:09,126 --> 00:41:10,417
<i>我们来进行提炼</i>
<i>We'll extract it.</i>

585
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:12,917
啊，你自己做的啊？真是太好了
Ah, you make your own ? Good to know.

586
00:41:13,126 --> 00:41:16,876
我现在可以告诉我老婆了，她对丁香很着迷
I can tell my wife now, she's obsessed with cloves.

587
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:21,959
她让我给她买一些
I'll get some supplies in, I'll take 50.

588
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:25,126
<i>丁香酚经过氢氧化钾和戊醇的处理后</i>
<i>Eugenol treated with potassium hydroxide and amyl alcohol</i>

589
00:41:25,292 --> 00:41:26,292
<i>就变成异丁香酚</i>
<i>becomes isoeugenol.</i>

590
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:29,667
<i>要把它变成MD2P我们还需要用到过硼酸钠</i>
<i>To transform it into MD2P we need sodium perborate.</i>

591
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:32,376
<i>我们可以从水族箱专用盐里提取</i>
<i>We'll extract that from the integrators for aquariums.</i>

592
00:41:35,334 --> 00:41:37,542
我有一个非常巨大的水族箱
I've got a huge aquarium.

593
00:41:37,751 --> 00:41:42,001
<i>然后我们需要大量的蒸馏水，还需要糖霜做赋形剂</i>
<i>Then we need lots of distilled water, and icing sugar as an excipient.</i>

594
00:41:45,292 --> 00:41:47,751
<i>第三步。生产。利用还原胺化反应</i>
<i>Phase 3. Production. Using reductive amination,</i>

595
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,709
<i>MD2P和丙氨酸可以为我们提供精神制剂</i>
<i>the MD2P and alanine will provide us with our smart drug.</i>

596
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,334
<i>到了这一步就无路可退，我们从现在起就在同一条船上了</i>
<i>The point of no return, we're all involved from here on.</i>

597
00:41:53,542 --> 00:41:54,917
好吧，彼得罗，对不起
All right, Pietro, I'm sorry.

598
00:41:55,126 --> 00:41:57,834
就我而言，没戏了。跟其他人说再见吧
As far as I'm concerned, it's over. Say goodbye to the others.

599
00:41:58,126 --> 00:42:02,001
- 现在怎么办，阿尔贝托？   - 你问我现在怎么办？
- What is it now, Alberto ?   - You're asking me what it is ?

600
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:05,126
你建议用硼氢化钠来进行还原胺化反应
You're suggesting sodium borohydride for reductive amination,

601
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:08,001
这么低级的事随便哪个吸毒的都会...
which is something so amateur any street junkie could do it...

602
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:11,792
- 哪有那么低级？   - 彼得罗，咱们实话实说
- It's not that amateur.   - Pietro, let's be honest.

603
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:17,292
要是你早讲用硼氢化钠来造毒品，我根本不会答应
If you'd said let's make a drug with sodium borohydride, I'd have said no.

604
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,459
- 嘘，中国人   - 我们是不是想造出像点样的毒品
- Sssh, the Chinese.   - Do we want to make a good drug,

605
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,126
合成达到一定级别的精神类药品？
synthesizing psychotropic substances of a certain level ?

606
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:24,084
达不到一定的纯度级别我们就不能干！
We can't go below a certain purity level !

607
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,209
不然的话，那种品相没人会喜欢的！
Otherwise it'll look bad and I won't have that !

608
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:30,459
好吧！好吧，算了！我们就用氢和铑
All right ! All right, come on ! We'll use hydrogen and rhodium.

609
00:42:30,667 --> 00:42:32,126
- 满意了？   - 可以！可以！
- Happy ?   - Yes ! Yes!

610
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,001
不过，阿尔贝托，你真够讨厌的！
But, Alberto, what a pain !

611
00:42:36,209 --> 00:42:38,251
<i>我们要利用大学试验室</i>
<i>We'll use the university lab.</i>

612
00:42:38,459 --> 00:42:43,126
<i>需要几个小时。我们周五晚上去，基本没人</i>
<i>We'll need a few hours, we'll go in on Friday night, when it's empty.</i>

613
00:42:43,292 --> 00:42:46,334
- 只是一道门，爬上翻过去   - 这没用
- It's only one gate, climb it backwards.   - That's not helping.

614
00:42:46,542 --> 00:42:49,251
好吧。别慌。抓住把手
All right. Don't panic. Take the handle,

615
00:42:49,459 --> 00:42:53,667
接着逆时针旋转180°，然后到我这边来
then an anticlockwise movement for 180 degrees and come towards me.

616
00:42:53,876 --> 00:42:55,626
我应该下去再来一次
I should go back down and start again.

617
00:42:55,834 --> 00:43:00,001
我们已经来了半个小时了。快点，监控会发现我们的
We've been here half an hour. Hurry up, the security camera will see us.

618
00:43:00,209 --> 00:43:04,209
- 往左？   - 往左，来吧。不难，来
- Left ?   - Left, go. It's easy, go.

619
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:09,167
阿尔贝托！你说你虽然很胖但也很灵巧，可你就是个木墩子！
Alberto ! You said you were solid but agile, you're an armchair!

620
00:43:09,376 --> 00:43:12,542
- 把手给我   - 我的手？   - 对，伸过来
- Give me your hand.   - My hand ? - Yes, give me it.

621
00:43:12,751 --> 00:43:15,334
- 我就交给你了   - 手给我，快点
- I'm trusting you.   - Give me your hand. Come.

622
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:18,667
- 我撑不住了   - 什么？谁能拉得动你？
- I'll let go.   - What ? Who could hold you ?

623
00:43:18,876 --> 00:43:22,251
下去重来吧。这是唯一的。。。
Go down and come back up. It's the only...

624
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:36,917
阿尔贝托！
Alberto !

625
00:43:38,584 --> 00:43:42,001
- 我真想念这地方   - 嗯，快点
- I really missed this place.   - Yeah, come on.

626
00:44:57,501 --> 00:45:01,917
除去赋形剂外，达到99%的纯度！
99% pure, apart from the excipients !

627
00:45:02,126 --> 00:45:05,167
你不会怪我省了几个零的
You'll forgive me if I'm a few zeroes out.

628
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:07,501
你得使用高效液相色谱才能知道具体的纯度级别
To see certain levels of purity, you need HPLC.

629
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:11,334
是啊，阿尔贝托！两小时后这地方就全是人了！
Yes, Alberto ! In two hours this place will be full of people !

630
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,251
我们必须抓紧时间
We have to get a move on.

631
00:45:13,459 --> 00:45:16,376
对，可这只是个整数，不能用来出售
Yes, but this is the zero number, this is not for sale.

632
00:45:16,584 --> 00:45:20,376
不，我拿一个放我钱包里，行吗？
No, I'll take this one and put it in my wallet, OK ?

633
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,334
- 没问题   - 别担心了，但是动作要快！
- All right.   - So don't worry, but hurry up !

634
00:45:22,542 --> 00:45:26,209
听着，我们要把整套试验做全吗？
Listen, are we going to do the whole testing phase ?

635
00:45:26,417 --> 00:45:29,834
- 对，当然做全   - 是吗？
- Yes, of course we will.   - We will ?

636
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:33,001
你把这叫做科学试验？
You call this scientific testing ?

637
00:45:33,209 --> 00:45:37,542
当然！不过我们就在这里做，而不是在试验室！
Of course ! But instead of doing it in the lab, we do it right here !

638
00:45:37,751 --> 00:45:40,917
可在这种乱七八糟的环境里我们怎么收集试验证据？
How can we collect empirical evidence in this chaos ?

639
00:45:41,126 --> 00:45:43,834
这环境根本就不适合，甚至起反作用
It's not a suitable environment, it's hostile even.

640
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:46,001
那些家伙从没来过夜总会
And these guys have never been in a club.

641
00:45:46,209 --> 00:45:48,501
这就是我们需要一位人类学家的原因
That's why we got an anthropologist.

642
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:53,667
好的，最后一次。在夜总会里，肢体语言很重要
Right, for the last time. In a club, body language is fundamental.

643
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:57,626
如果你把胳膊指向出口处...把你的脚伸直！
If your arms are pointing to the exit... Straighten your feet !

644
00:45:57,834 --> 00:46:01,251
就意味着我们有了负罪感，等不及要走了。那可不好！
It means we feel guilty and can't wait to go. That's no good !

645
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:04,126
高昂的下颔意味着自信
The raised chain is synonymous with self-assurance,

646
00:46:04,334 --> 00:46:07,167
而且以人类学角度而言非常适合吸引那些
and is anthropologically perfect to attract everyone in here

647
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:10,209
想要离经叛道一晚的人
who wants to have a night off from ordinary morals.

648
00:46:10,417 --> 00:46:12,709
所以把下颔抬高，绝对不要往那个方向看
So raised chin, never looking in that direction.

649
00:46:14,167 --> 00:46:17,209
<i>从少量的自我推销开始介绍我们自己</i>
<i>Start with a little self-marketing to introduce ourselves.</i>

650
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:20,834
棒级了！
Great !

651
00:46:21,084 --> 00:46:23,876
<i>直到他们来找我们</i>
<i>Until it's them who come to us.</i>

652
00:46:26,667 --> 00:46:27,917
你有我需要的东西？
You got something for me ?

653
00:46:28,126 --> 00:46:31,292
<i>光有他们的需求是不够的，必须要他们渴求</i>
<i>It's not enough for them to want it, they have to desire it.</i>

654
00:46:31,501 --> 00:46:34,667
- 去别的地方走走！   - 别担心，我有钱！
- Go for a walk!   - Don't worry, I've got money !

655
00:46:37,542 --> 00:46:39,959
到洗手间去看看
Go and check the restroom.

656
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:44,001
- 洗手间？   - 洗手间，去吧
- The restroom ?   - The restroom, go.

657
00:46:44,209 --> 00:46:46,417
<i>在洗手间里，关系会发生改变</i>
<i>In the restroom, relationships change,</i>

658
00:46:46,626 --> 00:46:49,376
<i>大家会变得更融洽，即使是跟陌生人</i>
<i>people become more complicit even with strangers.</i>

659
00:46:49,584 --> 00:46:52,209
<i>卫生间区域以性别划分</i>
<i>The toilet area discriminates on a gender basis,</i>

660
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:53,959
<i>男性在那边，女性在那边</i>
<i>males there, females there,</i>

661
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:57,209
<i>性别间的压力会消除</i>
<i>and so sexual tensions are smoothed out.</i>

662
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,792
- 有人告诉我来这儿可以...   - 200欧元
- I was told to come here for...   - 200 euros.

663
00:47:01,001 --> 00:47:04,251
- 200欧元，这是他妈什么玩意？   - 真有劲，谢谢
- 200 euros, what the hell is it ?   - A bomb, thank you.

664
00:47:04,459 --> 00:47:08,626
- 我怎么跟你说的？   - 至少让我看一眼？
- What did I tell you ?   - Can I see it, at least ?

665
00:47:08,834 --> 00:47:10,126
先给钱
Money first.

666
00:47:14,542 --> 00:47:16,584
拿去！不过要是你敢耍我...
Here ! But if you rip me off...

667
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,417
- 敲最后那扇门。相信我   - 好吧
- Knock at the last door. Trust me.   - All right.

668
00:47:34,126 --> 00:47:39,334
- 这系统不错！干得漂亮。再见   - 再见，帅哥
- What a system ! Well done. Bye.   - Bye, handsome.

669
00:47:46,251 --> 00:47:49,584
瞧，我怎么跟你说的？
Look. What did I tell you ?

670
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,459
抱歉
Excuse me.

671
00:47:57,417 --> 00:47:58,084
你好
Hello.

672
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,834
我是洗手间精神药品销售团队的
I'm part of the psychotropic sales team in the restroom.

673
00:48:02,126 --> 00:48:06,334
- 我想知道你用了有什么感觉   - 这玩意挺酷的
- I wanted to ask what you thought.   - This stuff is spectacular.

674
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,792
能说具体一点吗？
Could you be more specific ?

675
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:13,626
当我过去敲卫生间的门时，我觉得这套系统很不错
When I went to knock on the restroom door, I saw the system is perfect.

676
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:15,667
- 跟穆雷纳学得有模有样   - 谁？
- Well clone, Murena.   - Who ?

677
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:19,001
穆雷纳。手里有顶级货的家伙。你不是替穆雷纳干活的？
Murena. The guy with the best stuff. Do you not work for Murena ?

678
00:48:19,209 --> 00:48:20,917
我不认识穆雷纳。我替彼得罗干活
I don't know Murena. I work for Pietro.

679
00:48:21,126 --> 00:48:24,626
要是按你的满意度打个分，按照...
If you were to grade your satisfaction on a scale of...

680
00:48:24,834 --> 00:48:26,834
那妞是你带来的？
Is that your woman there ?

681
00:48:27,126 --> 00:48:29,376
不，不是。你能集中一小会吗？
No, she's not. Can you concentrate a moment ?

682
00:48:29,584 --> 00:48:31,876
嗯，我想我要去试试运气
Well, I think I'll try my luck.

683
00:48:32,126 --> 00:48:34,001
抱歉！一小会，就一个问题！
Excuse me ! One moment, a question !

684
00:48:34,209 --> 00:48:37,501
40分钟，各位，我们40分钟就搞定了！
40 minutes, guys, we finished it in 40 minutes !

685
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:44,209
不可思议！现在还不足以调整价格，我们得多生产一些
Amazing ! It's not enough to adjust the price, we have to make more.

686
00:48:44,417 --> 00:48:49,126
好的，不过我想提一下分工的问题
All right, but I'd like to bring up the division of labor.

687
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:52,001
我发现有歧视、幽闭
I found it discriminatory, claustrophobic

688
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:53,792
尤其是卫生问题：
and above all unhygienic:

689
00:48:54,001 --> 00:48:57,001
我坐在马桶上面整整两个小时
I was two hours sitting above the toilet bowl,

690
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,126
从门底下塞纸袋！
passing bags under the door !

691
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:01,584
乔吉奥，你的角色非常重要，看出来了？
Giorgio, your role is fundamental, you see ?

692
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:04,209
卫生间是底牌。万一警察来了
The WC is the estrema ratio. If the police come,

693
00:49:04,417 --> 00:49:07,292
你把药丢进马桶，拿水一冲，我们干干净净走人！
you chuck it in the bowl, flush it away, and we're home free !

694
00:49:08,334 --> 00:49:11,792
可我们不是说过这些都是合法的吗？
But did we not say all this was legal ?

695
00:49:12,001 --> 00:49:17,667
说了一百遍了，我们出售的东西本身不是违法的
For the hundredth time, what we're selling in itself is not illegal,

696
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:21,542
但我们却在没有许可的情况下贩卖内服药品
but we're selling something that is ingested without any license,

697
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:24,126
而且没有处方，所以这是逃税行为！
and without receipts, so it's tax avoidance !

698
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:27,334
还有，阿尔贝托，别去打扰那些客户
And, Alberto, leave the customers in peace.

699
00:49:27,542 --> 00:49:29,959
他们不是喜欢这药吗？这就够了
They like it ? That means it's good.

700
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:36,001
<i>树皮被浸透后就会放入火中以营造温暖和温馨的气氛</i>
ONCE SOAKED THE BARK IS PLACED ON THE FIRE TO MAKE IT WARM AND SOFT

701
00:49:51,959 --> 00:49:55,542
听着，我一直在想，咱们弄台洗碗机吧
Listen, I was thinking, let's get the dishwasher.

702
00:49:57,417 --> 00:49:59,917
你说了别太贪心
You said not to be too greedy.

703
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:04,501
没错，不过这个很有用的。我们就贪心一下
Yeah, but it's something useful. Let's be greedy.

704
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,501
不过买台酷的
But get a cool one.

705
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:11,126
- 你去哪？   - 去看看乔吉奥和马蒂亚
- Where are you going ?   - To see Giorgio and Mattia.

706
00:50:11,334 --> 00:50:13,376
又来了！这周第三次了！
Again ! That's the third time this week !

707
00:50:13,584 --> 00:50:15,334
可能是最后一次
And it might be the last.

708
00:50:15,542 --> 00:50:17,501
他们现在有被开除的风险！
They're at risk of being fired !

709
00:50:17,709 --> 00:50:21,251
我过去，聊聊天，想给他们打打气
I go there, chat, try to cheer them up a bit.

710
00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:25,876
确实有用。其实他们也说了：“这对我们很有用”
It really helps them. In fact they said, "It really helps us."

711
00:50:26,126 --> 00:50:28,501
那是新夹克吗？丝质的？
Is that a new jacket ? Is it silk ?

712
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:32,959
不是，睛纶混纺的。捂我一身汗
No, it's an acrylic mix. Really makes me sweat.

713
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:37,417
- 要不要我等你？   - 不用，亲爱的，睡吧。我很晚才能回来
- Will I wait up for you ?   - No, love, sleep, I'll be late.

714
00:50:40,001 --> 00:50:41,584
我真得不想去！
I really don't want to go !

715
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:17,667
它的名字叫波希米亚狂想曲
And then we have Bohemian Rhapsody.

716
00:51:17,876 --> 00:51:23,667
一条非常独特的狗，可以搜寻、捕猎、带回猎物
An exceptional dog, it seeks, hunts, retrieves.

717
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:28,084
- 你究竟想要哪种？   - 我们就要它了
- What exactly are you looking for ?   - We'll take it.

718
00:51:38,584 --> 00:51:44,959
我们来了。这里是南罗马和托里诺的收入。瞧瞧
Here we are. This is South Rome and Torrino. Look at that.

719
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:50,126
- 等等，安德里亚，这是什么？   - 五欧元的钞票
- Hang on, Andrea, what's this ?   - Five euros.

720
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:53,709
我们不能收小面额的！我们不能整晚坐在这里数钱！
We don't take small notes ! We can't be here all night counting !

721
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:55,251
可以小小变通一下嘛
A bit of flexibility.

722
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:59,209
手里有小零钱的人不应该是我们的客户
If they have small change, they're not our clientele.

723
00:52:10,751 --> 00:52:13,501
各位，我们将要去参观一些典雅的人文景观！
Guys, we're about to go somewhere anthropologically delicate !

724
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:17,667
很容易就能打动他们！别让我难堪
It won't take much to set things off ! Don't make me look bad.

725
00:52:17,876 --> 00:52:22,001
要是有人感兴趣的话，这就是文书院宫
If anyone's interested, this is Palazzo della Cancelleria.

726
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:25,334
不是每个人都知道它有着达马西称号
Not everyone knows it contains the Titulus Damasi,

727
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:28,667
- 一般叫它圣洛伦索   - 够了！够了！
- commonly known as San Lorenzo.   - Enough ! Enough !

728
00:52:28,876 --> 00:52:31,834
- 这裤子让我血脉不畅！   - 这种二分款真美
- These pants are haemostatic !   - The distichous is beautiful,

729
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:33,959
- 专为达玛苏...   - 我脱不下来了！
- dedicated to Damasus...   - I can't get them off!

730
00:52:34,167 --> 00:52:40,501
不是所有人都知道她把教堂。。。算了，你们也不在意，我知道
Haec damasus tibi christe deus, all right, you don't care, I know.

731
00:52:40,792 --> 00:52:46,709
我男朋友是天蝎座，有非常强烈的统治欲
My boyfriend is a Scorpio, very strong dominating character,

732
00:52:46,917 --> 00:52:50,584
天蝎座运势，一个天蝎座大块头，真正的天蝎座！
Scorpio ascendant, a big Scorpio, really Scorpio !

733
00:52:50,792 --> 00:52:53,959
我们也没必要搞得那么夸张！听着！
Just as well as we didn't have to overdo it ! Listen !

734
00:52:54,667 --> 00:52:57,292
- 要货吗？   - 要，能让我晚上嗨起来
- You need some stuff ?   - Yeah, that would make my night.

735
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:00,292
- 900欧元   - 900欧元
- 900.   - 900.

736
00:53:01,334 --> 00:53:07,417
讲真，各位，就和以前的生活方式一样，明白吗？
I mean it, guys, exactly the same lifestyle as before, understood ?

737
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:33,584
嗨。你能看得出来，我跟你一样是同性恋
Hi. As you can see, I'm a homosexual like you.

738
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:36,959
我就是想问问你刚才服的药
I wanted to ask about that substance you just took,

739
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:43,209
不过别担心，不记名的，只是用来研究...你干什么？
but don't worry, it's anonymous, it's research... What are you doing ?

740
00:53:46,626 --> 00:53:49,876
好，谢谢你。不，我是想问你
Yes, thank you. No, I wanted to ask you,

741
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:54,667
比如，你对我无法扼制的性冲动
for example, that sexual impulse towards me you cannot control,

742
00:53:54,876 --> 00:53:59,334
是不是依赖你刚才服的药？或者仅仅是因为你喜欢我？
does that depend on what you took ? Or is it just you like me ?

743
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:04,459
好吧，没关系。得了，住手！别！
All right, it doesn't matter. Come on, stop it ! No !

744
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:29,417
- 彼得罗   - 这他妈是什么？
- Pietro.   - What the fuck is this ?

745
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:31,292
- 洗碗机   - 我知道，可是...
- The dishwasher.   - I know, but...

746
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:36,209
- 你刚到家吗？   - 不是，我刚才...
- Have you just got home ?   - No, I was just...

747
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:40,751
- 我正要去大学   - 你那是皮裤吗？
- I was going to university.   - Are those leather pants ?

748
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:49,959
什么？不...挺舒适的，我买的特价
Who ? No... they're really comfy and I got them in the sales.

749
00:54:50,292 --> 00:54:52,126
你要在早上六点上班？
You're going to work at 6 in the morning ?

750
00:54:52,251 --> 00:54:55,959
教授要我给他帮个忙，因为我们经常这样，朱莉亚
The professor asked me for a favor, because we're like this, Giulia.

751
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,001
你至少把早饭吃了吗？
Have you had breakfast at least ?

752
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:08,792
我是说，虽然，彼得罗，要我说，你表现得怪怪的
I mean, though, Pietro, let me say, you're acting a bit strange.

753
00:55:10,001 --> 00:55:14,376
看你这身打扮，就跟吉姆·莫里森一样（摇滚歌星）
Look at the way you're dressed, you look like Jim Morrison.

754
00:55:14,542 --> 00:55:17,334
还有就是每天晚上去乔吉奥和马蒂亚那
And then this thing about going to see Giorgio and Mattia every night.

755
00:55:17,501 --> 00:55:20,501
我理解你对于他们在加油站打工
I know you feel guilty they're pumping gas

756
00:55:20,709 --> 00:55:23,501
而你却拿到了大学长期合同而过意不去...
and you've got a long-term contract at university...

757
00:55:24,626 --> 00:55:28,834
- 彼得罗！你在听吗？   - 加油...
- Pietro ! Are you listening ?   - Pumping gas...

758
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:33,042
没什么，我在听，朱莉亚。不过我们总是
No, I was listening, Giulia. But we always talk

759
00:55:33,209 --> 00:55:36,459
谈这些相同的话题。乔吉奥、马蒂亚、大学...
about the same things. Giorgio, Mattia, university...

760
00:55:36,626 --> 00:55:39,792
一般人都要睡着了
It's normal for someone to fall asleep.

761
00:55:40,042 --> 00:55:47,792
你从来不跟我讲你自己，你的情况。来，说说吧？
You never talk to me about you, how you are. There, how are you ?

762
00:55:50,042 --> 00:55:53,501
工作上一团糟
Work's a real disaster.

763
00:55:53,709 --> 00:55:56,834
吸毒的人数再次猛增
There's been a big rise in people taking drugs again.

764
00:55:57,084 --> 00:55:58,792
一些新型药品正在流行...
There are these new pills going round...

765
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:03,667
...很多人再次回到吸毒的路上
...so many people have started using again.

766
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:07,292
而且这些药物似乎不算是违禁品
And it seems this thing's not officially illegal.

767
00:56:07,501 --> 00:56:13,751
所以目前他们毫无办法。这些家伙肆无忌惮
So they can't do anything for now. These people are so unscrupulous,

768
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:19,917
我真想跳过审讯直接把他们关起来，终身监禁，这些杂种！
I'd lock them up without even a trial, life in jail, these shits !

769
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:25,042
喂，“杂种”这词有点过了
Well, "shits" seems a bit over the top,

770
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:30,667
也许他们遇到了困难，要申请取缔非常容易
maybe they've had problems, and it's too easy to demand a clampdown.

771
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:32,876
彼得罗，你到底在说什么？
Pietro, what the fuck are you saying ?

772
00:56:33,084 --> 00:56:36,667
他们弄出近几年最好的毒品之一，你却在为他们辩解？
They put one of the best drugs in years out there and you defend them ?

773
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:44,501
不...但是是谁这么说，说这些药品非常酷？
No... but who said that, that these pills are cool ?

774
00:56:44,792 --> 00:56:47,459
那些曾经尝试过的人！还有谁？
The people that have tried them ! Who else ?

775
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:55,251
他们怎么说的？这些药是，比方说，一般酷或是真心酷，酷？
What did they say ? Are they, like, normal cool or really cool, cool ?

776
00:56:55,459 --> 00:57:00,501
- 你疯了吗？   - 没有，只是聊一聊
- Are you insane ?   - No, it was just to have a chat.

777
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,626
你说我们从没聊过天
You say we never talk.

778
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:15,751
你不饿吗？不喜欢？要不要点别的东西？
Are you not hungry ? You not like it ? You want something else ?

779
00:57:16,042 --> 00:57:19,417
先生，菜单上说这是50欧元一盘！
Sir, it says here this is 50 euros a plate !

780
00:57:19,584 --> 00:57:24,292
我跟你们说过。我们的津贴往上涨了...我来付帐
I told you. They increased our allowances... I'll get it.

781
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:28,459
想想第二道菜，光鱼类就有三页
Think about a second course, there's three pages of fish alone.

782
00:57:28,626 --> 00:57:31,084
随您怎么讲，先生
If you say so, sir.

783
00:57:31,376 --> 00:57:34,626
我对什么人办什么事
I deal stuff of a certain level for people of a certain level.

784
00:57:34,834 --> 00:57:39,792
我组织的派对，快乐大本营，是为了让大家高兴
The parties I organize, Happiness, are to entertain people,

785
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:43,042
- 让他们留下回忆并感激我   - 当然
- so they remember and are grateful.   - Of course.

786
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:48,167
我们说的是每晚2万多欧元
We're talking 20,000 a night plus.

787
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:52,417
我在罗马经常用到这位穆雷纳。我不知道你是否认识他
In Rome I've always used this Murena. I don't know if you know him.

788
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:56,542
知道，我听说过这位穆雷纳
Yes, I've heard something about this Murena.

789
00:57:56,751 --> 00:58:00,834
不过我可以保证我们有当前市场上最好的产品
But I can guarantee we have the best product on the market at the moment.

790
00:58:01,084 --> 00:58:07,501
好吧，你可以收下我漂亮的名片，放进你的口袋
All right, you take my nice business card, put it in your pocket,

791
00:58:07,709 --> 00:58:12,876
给我发条普通短信，我们下次见面谈谈细节
send me a neutral text message and we'll meet to discuss the details.

792
00:58:13,126 --> 00:58:18,292
这是150平米的休息厅，是真正的珠宝
This is the lounge and with its 150 square meters it's a real jewel.

793
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:21,501
正如你所见，这露台有着极佳的罗马市区视角
As you can see, the terrace offers an unrivaled view of downtown Rome,

794
00:58:21,709 --> 00:58:27,126
上层露台有温水泳池，桑拿和一个小健身房
while the upper terrace has a heated pool, sauna and a small gym.

795
00:58:27,334 --> 00:58:29,876
你们想待多久？
How long were you thinking of staying ?

796
00:58:30,126 --> 00:58:33,501
我们想的是长期方面
We were thinking more of an open-ended thing.

797
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,917
- 这根是承重柱吗？   - 您说什么？
- Is this a bearing pillar ?   - Pardon ?

798
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,917
也许该把它敲掉，感觉有点挡事
To knock it down maybe, it's all a bit claustrophobic.

799
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:42,501
这里是旅馆，你不能做出改动
This is a hotel, you can't rebuild it.

800
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:48,209
我们的想法只不过是来自后工业化的现代开放空间
It's just we come from a post-industrial modern open space.

801
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:49,834
不管怎么说，我们要了
But anyway we'll take it.

802
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:56,584
好了，阿尔贝托，继续
On you go, Alberto, go on.

803
00:58:59,126 --> 00:59:01,834
这只是一次科学试验
It's just a scientific experiment.

804
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:03,626
你已经做了很多次了，不是吗？
You've done lots, haven't you ?

805
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,334
勇敢点，勇敢点，勇敢点
Be brave, be brave, be brave.

806
00:59:54,376 --> 00:59:56,292
你们抢生意抢到这儿来了？
You're breaking our balls here too ?

807
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:58,167
滚一边去！你想干嘛？
Fuck off! What do you want ?

808
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:02,501
- 他还敢还嘴！   - 哥们，这儿是穆雷纳的地盘
- He answers back as well !   - Buddy, Murena's in charge here.

809
01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:07,917
“哥们，这儿是穆雷纳的地盘”。你看太多美剧了
"Buddy, Murena's in charge here." You watch too many American movies...

810
01:00:08,167 --> 01:00:14,084
该死，老天，你把我鼻子打破了！你疯了吗？
Fuck, Christ, you've broken my nose ! Are you mad ?

811
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:17,417
在托里诺搞一点就搞一点了，我们也不小气
Pushing a bit out at Torrino was OK, we let you do that,

812
01:00:17,584 --> 01:00:19,376
可你们现在在挑逗我们的神经
but now you're pissing us off.

813
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:24,376
下次再让我们看见你们，我们就开枪了，明白吗？
Next time we see you, we'll shoot you. Understand ?

814
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:28,042
- 没那个必要   - 这里是穆雷纳的地盘儿，懂？
- There was no need for that.   - This is Murena's patch, OK ?

815
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:33,917
不，各位，你们真地对美剧太入迷了...
No, guys, you're really obsessed with these American movies...

816
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:45,876
- 刚才是谁，巴尔托洛梅奥？   - 穆雷纳。穆雷纳的人
- Who was it, Bartolomeo ?   - Murena. Murena's men.

817
01:00:46,126 --> 01:00:49,209
该死的穆雷纳！该死的穆雷纳！
Fucking Murena ! Fucking Murena !

818
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:53,209
我总是听到他的名字，穆雷纳，你把我惹毛了！
I keep hearing his name, Murena, you've broken my balls !

819
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,501
- 这些是不折不扣的坏蛋   - 你不懂，巴尔托洛梅奥
- These are real bad guys.   - You don't understand, Bartolomeo.

820
01:00:56,709 --> 01:01:00,417
- 我们现在才是坏蛋   - 我们得把他们搞定！
- We're the bad guys now.   - We need to screw them !

821
01:01:00,584 --> 01:01:03,459
我们得找点称手的家伙把他们脸打扁！
We'll get some cold weapons and smash their faces in !

822
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,501
你干了什么？
What have you done ?

823
01:01:04,667 --> 01:01:07,751
你不让我测试它们，所以我对自己说，试一下
You didn't let me test them, so I said to myself, try it.

824
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:10,209
喝点水，保持体内水份
Drink some water and stay hydrated.

825
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:13,459
- 彼得罗，我们该怎么办？   - 跟你们说，我们必须把他们搞定
- Pietro, what will we do ?   - I'm telling you, we have to screw them up .

826
01:01:13,626 --> 01:01:18,209
这东西挺黏，我们得解决发干的问题。记下来
This stuff's sticky, we need to sort out the dryness. Take a note.

827
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:20,751
各位，我们得改变一下思路
Guys, we need to really change mentality.

828
01:01:21,042 --> 01:01:25,584
我们不能总是去厕所，穿得像傻逼，挣点零花钱
We can't keep going to squats, dressed like fools, for loose change.

829
01:01:25,792 --> 01:01:28,042
我们得上个台阶
We have to go up a level.

830
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:37,042
- 你们有晚礼服吗？   - 有！不行，不太合身！
- Have you got a tux ?   - Yes ! No, it doesn't fit !

831
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:38,584
记下来！改晚礼服
Take a note ! Adjust tux.

832
01:02:00,042 --> 01:02:06,042
喂！太好了！你不知道看见你来我有多高兴
Hey ! Great ! You don't know how happy I am that you're here.

833
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:09,917
- 感谢您邀请我们   - 我们开始尽情享受这个夜晚吧
- Thank you for inviting us.   - Let's enjoy the evening now.

834
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:16,042
西蒙，你能去那边看着点吗？我来带你认识一下大家
Simon, will you deal with the giving and getting ? I'll introduce you.

835
01:02:45,084 --> 01:02:48,042
你好...我是阿尔贝托
Hello... I'm Alberto.

836
01:02:51,709 --> 01:02:52,876
我是红辣椒
Paprika.

837
01:02:53,834 --> 01:02:56,917
红辣椒。这名字不一般
Paprika. Unusual.

838
01:03:10,334 --> 01:03:14,334
抱歉离开一会。我马上回来。你不要离开
Excuse me a moment. I'll be right back. Don't you go anywhere.

839
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:19,501
以第三方名义办理的巴拿马手机卡，烧了吧
Forget it, really. Panamanian SIM card in a third party's name.

840
01:03:19,667 --> 01:03:24,084
他们全都能截听到，共谋罪够判9年的
They'll be on to you, and I was looking at nine years for conspiracy.

841
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:28,501
不过，如果你想图个安稳，那记下来，“Palabras”！
No, these days not to have any worries, write it down, Palabras !

842
01:03:28,667 --> 01:03:31,709
- “Palabras”？   - 玻利维亚第二大公司。很好的
- Palabras ?   - Second company in Bolivia. Great.

843
01:03:31,917 --> 01:03:34,209
- 感觉可靠吗？   - 可靠？
- In the sense it's secure ?   - Secure ?

844
01:03:34,417 --> 01:03:37,792
要是法官截听到了，我怎么说？
If the judge manages to tap this, what can I say ?

845
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:43,876
你不错，真不错。我会去自首。不过他不会截听到的
You're good, really good. I'll hand myself in. But he won't tap it.

846
01:03:44,126 --> 01:03:46,501
只要有我的，就会有你们的
Since I got one, everyone's got one.

847
01:03:46,667 --> 01:03:49,542
- 抱歉   - 你随意
- Excuse me.   - On you go.

848
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:54,459
亲爱的！不，我们和部长们在一起。他们希望明天颁布法令
Love ! No, we're with the ministers. They want the decree for tomorrow.

849
01:03:54,667 --> 01:03:56,751
- 彼得罗！   - 教授
- Pietro !   - Professor.

850
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:01,126
很高兴见到你！你在这儿做什么？你消失一阵子了！
It's good to see you ! What are you doing here ? You vanished !

851
01:04:01,334 --> 01:04:03,667
我一直在尽最大努力让你回来！
I'm doing all I can to get you back in !

852
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:08,584
我甚至去见了学校出去的一位老朋友，很有人脉的家伙
I even went to see an old friend from school, a guy with contacts.

853
01:04:08,792 --> 01:04:11,709
教授，谢谢你，不过我已经没有兴趣了，我改行了
Professor, thank you, but I'm not interested, I've changed fields.

854
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:16,251
你干得不错，你在大学里挣不到什么
You did well, you can't earn a fucking thing at university.

855
01:04:16,459 --> 01:04:20,209
抱歉，不过你刚才在跟帕拉佐副部长说话
Excuse me, but you were speaking with Undersecretary Pallazzo.

856
01:04:20,417 --> 01:04:22,042
对，别人介绍的。。。
Yes, I was introduced...

857
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:26,042
他和我的船停在同一个码头
He and I have our boats at the same pier,

858
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:28,751
可我从没有勇气接近他
but I've never been bold enough to approach him.

859
01:04:29,042 --> 01:04:32,459
不过要是你能在他面前帮我牵个线
But if you could maybe have a word with him about me,

860
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:35,209
至少让我加入国家研究委员会
get me a seat on the board of the NRC at least.

861
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:39,709
- 我不知道，教授...   - 去代表民间团体
- I don't know, Professor...   - To represent civil society.

862
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,667
- 抱歉，我真得要走了   - 等一等
- I'm sorry, I really have to go.   - Hang on.

863
01:04:41,876 --> 01:04:47,542
这是我的名片。我不得不换号了，萨勒诺地方检察官一直在找我麻烦
Take my card. I had to change numbers, the Salerno D.A. was hassling me.

864
01:04:47,751 --> 01:04:53,251
- 谢谢   - 看到+591的号码别见怪
- Thank you.   - Don't worry about the +591,

865
01:04:53,459 --> 01:04:57,709
是玻利维亚号码，说来话长了，以后我会告诉你的
it's a Bolivian number, it's a long story, I'll tell you later.

866
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:01,542
拉力赛能带给你的冲击不是其它运动可比的
Rallying gives you a rush that no other sport does.

867
01:05:01,751 --> 01:05:05,876
- 可是却有副作用！   - 那你现在级别挺高的了？
- But then there are side effects !   - So you're at a certain level ?

868
01:05:06,126 --> 01:05:11,876
我参加了最近的一次非洲艾克拉力赛，尽管有个垃圾导航
I was placed in the last Africa Eco Race despite an asshole navigator.

869
01:05:12,126 --> 01:05:16,251
在沙丘上，要是你没个好导航，你就完蛋了！
And on the dunes, if you don't have a good navigator, you're screwed !

870
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:18,751
我找了你将近半小时
I've been looking for you for half an hour.

871
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:23,126
- 你能给我一点货吗？   - 干嘛？
- Can you give me some stuff ?   - What for ?

872
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,251
做测试。我会把结果发给你。拿来！
The tests. I'll send you the file. Give !

873
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:27,917
阿尔贝托，你知道定期服用会上瘾的
Alberto, you know regular ingestion can lead to addiction.

874
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:30,042
别逗我了！把药给我！
Don't break my balls ! Give me the pills!

875
01:05:30,209 --> 01:05:32,459
悠着点！
Behave!

876
01:05:32,626 --> 01:05:34,084
- 快点！   -等等！
- Come on !   - Wait !

877
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:36,792
可又不是我！我为什么要说谎？
But that's not me ! Why would I lie ?

878
01:05:37,042 --> 01:05:39,292
得了，我知道是你！
Stop it, I know it's you !

879
01:05:39,501 --> 01:05:43,751
其实，我还认识你们帮派另一个家伙
In fact, I know that guy there is one of your gang too.

880
01:05:44,042 --> 01:05:50,751
什么帮派？哪有帮派。像他那种人会是帮派里的？不可能...
What gang ? There's no gang. Someone like him in a gang ? No way...

881
01:05:51,042 --> 01:05:54,042
- 我认识你们所有人，都认识！   - 这事和我无关
- I know all of you, I know !   - It's nothing to do with me.

882
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:00,251
不管怎么说我都不明白...
I don't understand though in what sense...

883
01:06:08,126 --> 01:06:10,376
啊，你说的是字面意思？
Ah, you mean literally ?

884
01:06:12,209 --> 01:06:14,917
当然，如果你这样想...
Of course, if you put it like that...

885
01:06:18,126 --> 01:06:19,542
是我
It's me.

886
01:06:20,584 --> 01:06:22,084
可是...
But...

887
01:07:03,917 --> 01:07:09,834
- 阿尔贝托，你在这做什么？   - 吃早餐
- Alberto, what are you doing here ?   - Having breakfast.

888
01:07:10,084 --> 01:07:12,042
我晚上有点累
I had a bit of a night.

889
01:07:12,209 --> 01:07:18,459
阿尔贝托，这两位是不是保镖？
Alberto, do you think these two are escorts ?

890
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:21,501
我想搞清楚，可她只用俄语回答
I tried to bring that up, but she only answered in Russian,

891
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:22,917
但是，不，我想不是的
but no, I don't think so.

892
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,542
阿尔贝托，她们是保镖
Alberto, they're escorts.

893
01:07:24,751 --> 01:07:27,501
你觉得那种女孩会看上我们这样的人吗？
You think girls like that would go with the likes of us ?

894
01:07:27,667 --> 01:07:29,751
那是你的看法！我就有更漂亮的女孩看上
Speak for yourself ! I've had better-looking girls.

895
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:34,042
- 谁？   - 维罗尼卡，博士学位，第二年
- Who ?   - Veronica, doctorate, second year.

896
01:07:45,376 --> 01:07:50,209
我觉得我们得给她们1000欧元
I think we'll need to give them 1,000 euros.

897
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:53,292
算是出于礼貌
Just out of politeness.

898
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:20,876
- 你去哪了？已经下午2点了！   - 在大学
- Where were you ? It's 2pm !   - At university.

899
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:28,084
- 看你满身酒气！   - 我们在用乙醇，所以。。。
- You stink of alcohol !   - We're using ethanol and so...

900
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:32,542
- 你身上穿着礼服去工作？   - 好啦，朱莉亚，听着
- You go to work in a tux ?   - Come on, Giulia, please,

901
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:37,251
昨天是我们一个同事的单身汉告别晚会，我们都穿着礼服。。。
it was a stag night for a colleague and we all dressed up in tuxes...

902
01:08:37,459 --> 01:08:42,584
单身汉告别晚会？谁的？哪位同事？
A stag night ? Whose ? What colleague ?

903
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:49,209
你认识的。。。詹。。。卢卡。。。奇拉。。。
You know... Gian...luca... Ciarra...

904
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:52,584
瓦那利。詹卢卡·奇拉瓦那利博士
vanellini. Doctor Gianluca Ciarravanellini.

905
01:08:52,792 --> 01:08:57,126
你是不是觉得我很好骗？我们怎么能买得起这些玩意？
Do you think I'm stupid ? How the fuck did we buy all these things ?

906
01:08:57,334 --> 01:09:01,251
3D电视，洗碗机，所有这些该死的外套，你差不多买了300件！
The 3D TV, the dishwasher, all these fucking jackets, you've got 300 of them !

907
01:09:01,459 --> 01:09:05,042
朱莉亚，冷静。我告诉过你的，这都来自2008年起的拨款。。。
Giulia, calm down. I told you, it's a grant from 2008...

908
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:08,126
我去了大学。他们说已经有几个月没见过你了！
I went to the university. They say they haven't seen you for months !

909
01:09:08,334 --> 01:09:09,709
至于什么长期合同。。。
As for the long term-contract...

910
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:15,501
第一，别用手指我。第二，别过问我的事
One, don't lift your hands to me. Two, keep your nose out my business.

911
01:09:15,709 --> 01:09:18,251
第三，我本来想告诉你的，我已经有了新的工作
Three, I was going to tell you, I've got a new job.

912
01:09:18,459 --> 01:09:22,209
是吗？种种迹象来看是份高收入的工作！
Yeah ? A well-paid one by the look of things !

913
01:09:23,542 --> 01:09:25,626
- 你从哪拿出来的？   - 你藏在哪就是哪！
- Where did you get this ?   - Where you hid it !

914
01:09:25,834 --> 01:09:27,501
这些该死的钱哪来的？
Where the fuck is this money from ?

915
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:31,834
这是我跟乔吉奥和马蒂亚一起干的，一项投资。。。
It's something I'm doing with Giorgio and Mattia, an investment...

916
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:37,251
- 这该死的钱是从哪里来的？   - 你想知道？是吗？该死！
- Where the fuck is this money from ?   - You wanna know ? You do ? Fuck !

917
01:09:37,459 --> 01:09:41,126
我现在是个毒贩！满意了？
I've become a dealer ! All right ?

918
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:45,126
- 滚你的吧！   - 不，是你滚！
- Fuck off !   - No, you fuck off !

919
01:09:45,334 --> 01:09:48,792
我被大学开掉了！明白吗？我被开掉了！
I got kicked out the university ! Understand ? I got kicked out !

920
01:09:49,042 --> 01:09:53,042
我不知道该怎么办，除了分子理论我一无所长
I don't know how to do anything, all I can do is theorize molecules,

921
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,334
所以我推理出一种能带给我回报的分子结构！
so I theorized one that gives me what I deserve !

922
01:09:56,542 --> 01:10:01,626
这个白痴竟然开始贩毒！而我还以为他有了个新欢！
This dickhead's started dealing ! And I thought he had a lover !

923
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:05,542
- 新欢？别跑题   - 这个白痴！
- A lover ? Don't change the subject.   - This dickhead !

924
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:10,167
- 我上班后该怎么讲？   - 朱莉亚，听着，我所做的一切都是为了我们
- What will I say at work ?   - Giulia, listen, I did it for us,

925
01:10:10,376 --> 01:10:14,584
能享受体面的生活，别把它彻底毁了
to have a decent life, don't blow it out of all proportion.

926
01:10:14,792 --> 01:10:16,751
我会攒些钱然后随时可以退出
I'll save some money then I can quit anytime I like.

927
01:10:18,417 --> 01:10:20,126
我该怎么跟我的孩子讲？
What do I tell my child ?

928
01:10:20,334 --> 01:10:24,251
爸爸在牢里，别把它彻底毁了！
Dad's in jail, don't blow it out of all proportion !

929
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:29,459
朱莉亚，你紧张的时候就会乱说一气。监牢和我有什么。。。
Giulia, when you're stressed you talk shit. What's jail got to do...

930
01:10:29,626 --> 01:10:31,001
什么孩子？
What child ?

931
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:34,417
彼得罗，我怀孕了
Pietro, I'm pregnant.

932
01:10:35,126 --> 01:10:36,459
你怀孕了？
You're pregnant ?

933
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:40,792
抱歉，你到底打算什么时候才告诉我？
I'm sorry, when the fuck were you going to tell me ?

934
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:43,417
你能肯定吗？
You're sure ?

935
01:10:43,584 --> 01:10:46,084
不是臆想型怀孕？
It's not a hysterical pregnancy ?

936
01:10:48,334 --> 01:10:49,501
滚蛋
Get out.

937
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:57,292
- 彼得罗！很高兴你在这儿   - 朱莉亚把我赶出来了
- Pietro ! I'm glad you're here.   - Giulia's kicked me out,

938
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,584
我得找个地方待几晚
I need somewhere to stay a couple of nights.

939
01:10:59,792 --> 01:11:02,876
巴尔托洛梅奥出了点状况。从辛蒂来了两位男士
There's a problem with Bartolomeo. There are two Sinti gentlemen here,

940
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,667
态度不怎么友好，我不想和他们有瓜葛
not at all friendly, I don't want anything to do with this.

941
01:11:05,876 --> 01:11:07,251
辛蒂？
Sinti ?

942
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:10,584
别碰我！我自己能走，没必要使用暴力。。。
Don't touch me ! I can come myself, there's no need for violence...

943
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:15,417
彼得罗，别问为什么，很明显是用辞方面理解有误
Pietro, don't ask, obviously a linguistic misunderstanding,

944
01:11:15,584 --> 01:11:18,251
他们说什么婚姻，我一点都不知道
they're talking about a marriage I know nothing about.

945
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:23,042
别碰我，我在走。我自己能走。。。
Don't touch me, I'm coming. I can come on my own...

946
01:11:29,792 --> 01:11:35,584
你知道的，这个模型不是用的伊特鲁里亚语，而是大希腊区语
As you know, the matrix isn't Etruscan, but Magna Graecia.

947
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,292
显然客户是伊特鲁里亚人
The client was Etruscan, obviously.

948
01:11:38,501 --> 01:11:43,667
我知道，抱歉，但不幸的是我们找不到更好的地方了
I know, I'm sorry, but unfortunately we couldn't find anything better.

949
01:11:43,876 --> 01:11:47,917
我早就想找个更大点的地方，这里有点挤
I'm already looking for something bigger, this is a bit cramped,

950
01:11:48,167 --> 01:11:50,334
没地方能摆下台球桌，那电影院。。。
there's no room for the pool table, the movie theater...

951
01:11:50,501 --> 01:11:55,542
- 马蒂亚，这些女孩子哪来的？   - 我不太清楚
- Mattia, who are all these girls ?   - I'm not really sure.

952
01:11:55,751 --> 01:12:01,667
从语言学上讲，在泳池里说的是斯拉夫语，但进了屋更像拉美语
Linguistically at the pool it's Slav, but more Latin-American indoors.

953
01:12:01,876 --> 01:12:06,792
姑娘们，那个不是烟灰缸！那是91年Certamen Ciceronianum大奖赛的奖杯！
Girls, that's not an ashtray ! It's the Certamen Ciceronianum Cup '91 !

954
01:12:07,042 --> 01:12:11,209
抱歉，那是国际大赛。92年的已经被你弄丢了
Sorry, it's an international competition. You've already lost '92.

955
01:12:11,459 --> 01:12:15,459
- 阿图罗，你在做什么？   - 穆洛的山墙装饰
- Arturo, what are you doing ?   - The acroterion of Murlo.

956
01:12:18,792 --> 01:12:23,876
这太让人意外了。真正的晴天霹雳
It was so unexpected. It was a real bolt from the blue.

957
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:27,501
我觉得我已经做好了准备，你知道的，准备做个父亲
I feel I'm ready. You know, to be a father.

958
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:32,792
我觉得我很失败，我们在一起这么多年
I feel I'm cut out for it, we've been together for years,

959
01:12:33,042 --> 01:12:36,792
有了爱情的结晶本来是多美妙啊
it would be a lovely thing to put the seal on our love.

960
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:42,042
- 你要不要口活？   - 什么意思，口活？
- You want a blow job ?   - What do you mean, a blow job ?

961
01:12:42,209 --> 01:12:46,417
我说的是某种复杂的个人动力。。。
I'm talking about personal dynamics of a certain complexity...

962
01:12:46,584 --> 01:12:52,251
- 不想要口活吗？   - 不，不要，算了！
- No blow job ?   - No, no blow job, come on !

963
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:54,459
不是针对个人。当作我接受了吧
Nothing personal. It's like I accepted.

964
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:59,126
这里有浴室吗？抱歉。口活
Is there a bathroom here ? I'm sorry. A blow job.

965
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:11,917
你就是个不负责任的杂碎。我讨厌这地方，滚吧！
YOU'RE AN IRRESPONSIBLE SHIT. I HATE THIS PLACE, FUCK OFF !

966
01:13:12,334 --> 01:13:15,584
- 你开始人身攻击了！   - 你也给我滚
- You're really getting personal !   - YOU FUCK OFF AS WELL.

967
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:20,084
她嫌这个地方太乱了，她想要个只属于我们的地方
All this chaos gets to her, she'd like a place just for us.

968
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:24,792
她说得对，这地方已经失去控制了。钱改变了他们的思想
She's right, this lot up there have lost it, the money's changed them.

969
01:13:25,084 --> 01:13:28,376
你有没有注意到这地方被妓女填满了？
Have you noticed this place is full of hookers ?

970
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:31,376
阿尔贝托，那不是那天晚上那个保镖吗？
Alberto, is that not the escort from the other night ?

971
01:13:31,584 --> 01:13:34,834
不，红辣椒不再是保镖了。她现在为我们工作，负责公共关系
No, Paprika's not an escort any more. She works for us now, does our PR.

972
01:13:35,626 --> 01:13:38,876
阿尔贝托，那东西省着点用。你服了多少？
Alberto, go easy with that stuff. How much are you taking ?

973
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:41,001
别担心！你没必要担心
Don't worry ! You mustn't worry.

974
01:13:41,209 --> 01:13:43,334
这周我会把结果用文件发给你
I'll send you the file with the results this week.

975
01:13:43,501 --> 01:13:48,417
- 阿尔贝托！   - 俄语的意思是“马上来”。酷！
- Alberto !   - It means coming in Russian. Cool !

976
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,542
我要走了，因为她要是生气的话，能把我吓到
I'm going, cos if she gets pissed, she frightens me a bit.

977
01:13:57,334 --> 01:14:00,667
耶！这药不错，彼得罗。这药不错，你应该尝试一下
Yeah ! It's good, Pietro. It's good, you need to try it.

978
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:04,292
听话，试试，你应该试试
Be good, try it, you need to try it.

979
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:25,042
我知道我辜负了你的信任。我让你们失望了，你们所有人
I realize I betrayed your trust. I let you down, all of you.

980
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:37,459
相比1000天这还不到一星期。问题是这种新药，很猛
Less than a week from 1,000 days. The problem is this new stuff, it's wild.

981
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:42,251
我以前用过药。我又不是雏
I've taken pills before, I'm no virgin,

982
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:46,751
不过，各位，这让人难以置信，它似乎。。。
but, guys, this is just unbelievable, it's something...

983
01:14:47,001 --> 01:14:50,376
我这辈子从没这么嗨过
I've never been so high in my life,

984
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:55,084
像是从你胸口喷涌而出的愉悦，一种。。。
it's like a jet of pleasure coming out your chest, a thing...

985
01:14:55,292 --> 01:14:59,292
好了，卢卡，你搞得好像在为这药打广告一样。抱歉
All right, Luca, all that's missing is the testimonial. Excuse me.

986
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:04,626
有事。肯定的
Spatial. Definitive.

987
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:11,292
整整三天你都不接电话。让我进去，我们谈谈
You haven't answered the phone in 3 days. Let me in, let's talk.

988
01:15:11,459 --> 01:15:14,667
彼得罗，你是个毒品贩子。你应该感谢我没去举报你
Pietro, you're a drug dealer. Be grateful I haven't reported you.

989
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:22,876
说了一百次了，我们这个配方在意大利不是违禁药
For the hundredth time, the molecule we produced is not illegal in Italy.

990
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:25,292
至少在政府清单下次更新前都不是的
Not till the Ministry's next update, at least.

991
01:15:25,459 --> 01:15:29,126
而且我或许是名销售人员，别叫我贩子，我不喜欢！
And I'm a salesman maybe, don't call me a dealer, I don't like it!

992
01:15:29,334 --> 01:15:32,417
朱得亚，朱莉亚。求你！对不起！好吗？
Giulia, Giulia. Please ! I'm sorry ! OK ?

993
01:15:32,626 --> 01:15:36,209
我很抱歉，但是肯定有办法解决这件事，不是吗？
I'm sorry, but there must be a way to sort things out, no ?

994
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:39,876
你说你随时可以退出。那就退出啊！马上！
You said you can quit anytime you want. So quit! Now!

995
01:15:40,126 --> 01:15:44,084
- 朱莉亚，这事有点复杂   - 这事复杂
- Giulia, it's complicated.   - It's complicated.

996
01:15:44,251 --> 01:15:48,209
这事涉及到了孩子。所以我们必须得谈谈。这也是我的孩子！
There's a child involved. So we have to talk. It's my child as well !

997
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:51,667
你想谈谈？那就谈吧！继续！我听着呢，谈
You want to talk ? Talk, then ! Go on ! I'm listening, talk.

998
01:15:53,084 --> 01:15:58,667
好吧，可是隔着围栏谈，还有。。。
All right, but talking with a fence between us, with...

999
01:15:58,876 --> 01:16:03,334
一群吸毒鬼在看着，不，我谈不来
all the junkies watching, no, I can't.

1000
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:08,584
晚餐吧，我就想要共进一次晚餐
One dinner, that's all I'm asking come to dinner one time.

1001
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:31,584
- 天呐！这是什么玩意？   - 一瓶97年的特级Aspero
- Goodness ! What is this stuff ?   - A '97 Aspero Superiore,

1002
01:16:31,792 --> 01:16:35,876
- 非常罕见，400欧元一瓶   - 这是亚硫酸盐汁！
- very rare, 400 euros a bottle.   - It's sulfite juice !

1003
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:39,417
你没弄到桑泰尔皮迪奥的Tenuta，德拉龙河？
You not got a Tenuta Sant'Elpidio, a De la Garonne ?

1004
01:16:41,084 --> 01:16:45,667
女士已经来了。我们一会再谈酒的事，这瓶不怎么样
The lady's here. We'll discuss the wine later, it's not good enough.

1005
01:16:46,084 --> 01:16:50,709
抱歉，那位先生已经包下了今晚的整场
I'm sorry, the gentleman has booked the whole place this evening.

1006
01:16:54,209 --> 01:17:01,251
这座位已经预订了，其实整座餐馆都预订了，所以，请。。。
This seat is taken, as indeed is the whole restaurant, so, please...

1007
01:17:01,417 --> 01:17:05,251
你真以为你可以不计后果地造成所有这些混乱吗？
You really thought you could cause all this chaos with no consequences ?

1008
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:07,417
什么？
Pardon ?

1009
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:12,876
你和你的屌丝朋友们突然冒出来
You and your loser friends appearing out of nowhere

1010
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:16,667
在这为所欲为！我该不该生气？
and doing as you like ! Should I be pissed ?

1011
01:17:16,876 --> 01:17:20,459
要是该有人生气的话，应该是我。你只是。。。
If anyone should be pissed, it's me. You're a...

1012
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,459
这他妈是什么？
What the fuck is this ?

1013
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:26,042
要是由我来做决定的话，我早就一枪崩了你
If it was up to me I'd have shot you already.

1014
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:30,209
但是市场说了算，而且你做的东西有需求
But the market is king, and there's a demand for what you make.

1015
01:17:33,834 --> 01:17:36,459
你是穆雷纳？
You're Murena ?

1016
01:17:39,084 --> 01:17:41,001
我是你的新雇主
I'm your new employer.

1017
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:46,417
不，听着，我们不替任何人打工，我们自己干。。。
No, look, we don't work for anyone, we work for ourselves...

1018
01:17:46,626 --> 01:17:47,917
你还没明白
You don't get it.

1019
01:17:48,834 --> 01:17:50,292
后天
Day after tomorrow,

1020
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:54,584
给我带10公斤那些你和你朋友们做出来的可爱药丸
bring me 10 kilos of those lovely pills you and your friends make,

1021
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,209
然后我们再说
and then we'll see.

1022
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:04,626
10公斤？两天内？你知道吗？我不干！
Ten kilos ? In two clays ? You know what ? I'm doing nothing !

1023
01:18:04,834 --> 01:18:12,667
你不知道我是谁！你不能就这么拿枪指着我然后。。。
You don't know who I am ! You can't just point your gun and...

1024
01:18:13,209 --> 01:18:15,626
你女朋友叫什么来着？
What's your girlfriend called ?

1025
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:21,917
那个社会服务人员，是不是？好吧！
The social worker, isn't she ? All right !

1026
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:36,251
- 该死！   - 朱莉亚？
- Fuck!   - Giulia ?

1027
01:18:36,417 --> 01:18:40,542
不，是阿尔贝托。彼得罗，出事了，别生气。。。
No, it's Alberto. Pietro, something's happened, don't be angry...

1028
01:18:40,751 --> 01:18:44,459
- 我的车失去了控制   - 车？什么车？
- I lost control of the coupe.   - The coupe ? What coupe ?

1029
01:18:44,667 --> 01:18:46,417
- 不，我没事   - 阿尔贝托，听着。。。
- No, I'm fine.   - Alberto, listen...

1030
01:18:46,626 --> 01:18:50,334
我是想把车控制住，但我刚跟红辣椒吵架了。。。
I was trying to get it out my system, I'd a fight with Paprika...

1031
01:18:50,501 --> 01:18:52,251
我没时间！我没时间
I don't have time ! I don't have time.

1032
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:56,167
不，不，等等。我还有事
No, no, wait. I called for another reason.

1033
01:18:56,334 --> 01:18:58,917
当他们检查汽车时
When they checked the car,

1034
01:18:59,126 --> 01:19:05,542
在车里，他们发现了半公斤我们那种药。。。
inside, they found half a kilo of our pills...

1035
01:19:08,084 --> 01:19:11,126
- 你车上有什么？   - 我没想到他们会检查！
- What did you have ?   - I didn't think they'd look!

1036
01:19:11,334 --> 01:19:14,376
警察都很狡猾，他们非常聪明。我本来不认为。。。
The police are sneaky, they're clever. I didn't think so...

1037
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:17,501
要是他们问你什么，闭好嘴巴，什么都别说。。。
If they ask anything, shut up, don't say...

1038
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:21,417
马上把电话挂了。跟我们去警局
Hang up now. Follow us to the station.

1039
01:19:21,709 --> 01:19:23,209
阿尔贝托！
Alberto !

1040
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:29,626
朱莉亚，你必须离开！我会来接你。。。
Giulia, you have to get away ! I'll come and get you...

1041
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:34,376
朱莉亚！是她的名字。我把电话给她，我想她有点生气了
Giulia ! That's her name. I'll put her on, I think she's a bit pissed.

1042
01:19:36,292 --> 01:19:42,417
亲爱的，别担心，一切都在控制之中，你不会有事的
Love, don't worry, it's all under control, nothing will happen to you.

1043
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:45,376
屁的控制！我已经被绑架了
Under fucking control ! I've been kidnapped.

1044
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:49,167
绑架？不，谈判还在继续，明白吗？
Kidnap ? No, there are ongoing negotiations, understand ?

1045
01:19:49,334 --> 01:19:51,167
开的价太高了。。。
Things were said...

1046
01:19:51,334 --> 01:19:54,292
如果他们想要赎金，你绝不能给
If they ask for a ransom, don't you pay it.

1047
01:19:54,459 --> 01:19:57,376
钱不能给。因为我一旦给放了，我要做的第一件事。。。
Don't pay it. Because as soon as I'm free, the first thing I'll do

1048
01:19:57,584 --> 01:20:01,667
就是打扁你那张无耻的脸，明白吗？蠢货！
is break your shitty face, do you understand ? Dickhead !

1049
01:20:03,001 --> 01:20:05,834
好吧。我想我们算是意见一致了
All right. I think we've reached an agreement.

1050
01:20:06,084 --> 01:20:10,417
别碰她！你不知道我的能力。你不知道！
Don't touch her ! You don't know what I'm capable of. You don't know !

1051
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:13,917
你能制做药丸。10公斤，后天
You're capable of making pills. 10 kilos, the day after tomorrow.

1052
01:20:16,167 --> 01:20:21,501
穆雷纳，别挂！听我说！穆雷纳！妈的！
Murena, don't hang up ! Listen to me ! Murena ! Fuck you !

1053
01:20:23,542 --> 01:20:24,834
妈的！
Fuck you !

1054
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:31,376
好，佩里，帮我弄明白这里的事情
Right, Petrelli, help me understand something here.

1055
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:37,751
交警说你当时在应急车道上时速超过了240公里
The traffic police say you were in the emergency lane doing 240km/h,

1056
01:20:38,001 --> 01:20:46,376
车是三天前以800欧元一天租的一辆银灰色4002轿车
in a metallic grey 4002 coupe, rented three days ago at 800 euros a day.

1057
01:20:46,584 --> 01:20:51,167
作为一个洗碗工，你的待遇很不错啊
For a dishwasher, you look after yourself.

1058
01:20:51,334 --> 01:20:55,126
接下来是后座上的八千欧元现金
Then on the rear seat there were 8,000 euros cash,

1059
01:20:55,334 --> 01:20:58,376
- 一根警棍和一支瓦斯手枪   - 自卫用的
- a night stick and a gas pistol.   - For self-defense.

1060
01:20:58,584 --> 01:21:04,126
但是真正让我感兴趣的是这袋子里装的半公斤药丸
But what interests me is this bag we found with half a kilo of pills

1061
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:09,834
现在正在试验室里检验，不过我倒是想猜猜看那是什么
which are being tested at the lab, but I'd take a guess at what it is.

1062
01:21:10,126 --> 01:21:12,501
但是不管怎么说那是一个完全合法的配方
But anyway it's a perfectly legal molecule.

1063
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:16,501
- 谁这样说？   - 政府部门有个清单。。。
- Says who ?   - The Ministry has a list...

1064
01:21:16,751 --> 01:21:21,376
- 这些东西你是怎么知道的？   - 卫生部的网站上有
- How do you know all this ?   - It's on the Health Ministry site.

1065
01:21:21,584 --> 01:21:25,292
- 我可以在电脑上给你看一下   - 你想耍我吗？
- I'll show you on the computer.   - You trying to piss me off ?

1066
01:21:25,584 --> 01:21:29,292
我们非常清楚你放在车里的药
We know the drug you had in the car really well.

1067
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:35,626
你加入了那个研究员帮派？脑子坏了吗？
You're in the researchers' gang ? What's wrong ?

1068
01:21:35,834 --> 01:21:42,126
你们以为我们什么都不知道，你们能够为所欲为？
You thought we didn't know anything, that you could what you liked ?

1069
01:21:42,334 --> 01:21:45,001
关于精神药剂你想不想说点什么？
You wanna have a talk about smart drugs ?

1070
01:21:45,917 --> 01:21:49,584
科勒蒂，是谁负责告诉政府关于新药剂的出现？
Coletti, who tells the Ministry about the new substances ?

1071
01:21:49,792 --> 01:21:52,667
是我们，就从这间办公室，探长
We do, from this office, Inspector.

1072
01:21:52,876 --> 01:21:55,667
所以说你来对地方了，阿尔贝托！
So you're in the right place, Alberto !

1073
01:21:55,876 --> 01:21:57,417
但我什么都不知道
But I don't know anything.

1074
01:21:57,626 --> 01:22:02,126
我只知道你不能这样抓我，我有权见律师！
All I know is you can't hold me like this, I have the right to a lawyer !

1075
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:06,084
好了，好了，我们面前就有一个
All right, all right, you've got one over us for now.

1076
01:22:06,292 --> 01:22:09,417
我不知道你是从哪弄到的这个配方，但是你知道
I don't know where you got this molecule from, but you did,

1077
01:22:09,626 --> 01:22:13,417
现在这个配方变成非法的只是个时间问题
and now it's only a question of time until the molecule becomes illegal.

1078
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:17,709
其他人是谁，阿尔贝托？
Who are the others, Alberto ?

1079
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:33,251
别在这瞎扯了！停！
Stop it with this bullshit ! Stop it !

1080
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:39,584
我们去找个律师把他弄出来。我们不清楚警察手里有什么
We'll get a lawyer and get him out. We don't know what the cops have.

1081
01:22:39,792 --> 01:22:43,667
你没在听。阿尔贝托跟红辣椒说过，他们全都知道了。有什么好笑的？
You're not listening. Alberto has been speaking to Paprika, they know everything. What's so funny ?

1082
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:48,334
但为什么是红辣椒？现在问题出在红辣椒身上。她的可靠度。。。
But why Paprika ? The problem's Paprika now. Her reliability...

1083
01:22:48,876 --> 01:22:52,084
你们能不能认真听一下？我们必须干一件事
Will you listen for a moment ? We have to do one thing.

1084
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:55,001
做最后一单，然后我们解散帮派分散开来
Do the last deal, then we break up the gang and split up.

1085
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:57,501
- 那阿尔贝托呢？   - 去他的阿尔贝托！
- And Alberto ?   - Fuck Alberto !

1086
01:22:57,709 --> 01:23:02,209
他是个喜欢飙车，整天与妓女为伴的吸毒鬼
He's a junkie who goes with hookers, crashing sports cars.

1087
01:23:02,376 --> 01:23:05,667
阿尔贝托会害我们全部进监狱的，懂吗！醒醒！
Alberto is going to send us all to jail, please ! Come on !

1088
01:23:07,501 --> 01:23:10,917
我们可以自首。考虑到减刑因素
We could give ourselves up. With the mitigating factors

1089
01:23:11,167 --> 01:23:13,209
我们能得到一个有利的判决
we might get a very favorable sentence.

1090
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:16,167
抱歉，抱歉，一个问题
Excuse me, excuse me, one question.

1091
01:23:16,334 --> 01:23:20,251
我们在试着怎么把一个人弄出监狱
We're trying to work out how to get someone out of jail,

1092
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:24,626
可你却想让大家都进监狱，你脑子进水了吗？
and you want us all to go to prison, what the fuck is wrong with you ?

1093
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:26,417
这只是个建议
It was just a suggestion.

1094
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:31,292
你知道我想不明白哪一点吗？你从什么时候开始有权力开口的？
You know what I don't get ? Since when did you have the right to speak ?

1095
01:23:31,459 --> 01:23:35,917
你就是靠你那辆卡车才能留在这。还记得吗？
You're only here cos you have a truck. You remember that ?

1096
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:39,376
是那个做了金融计划的高级金融天才说的。。。
Said the genius of high finance with his financial plan...

1097
01:23:39,584 --> 01:23:42,917
是谁付的钱？谁把钱弄来让这个业务开动的？
Who paid up ? Who found the money to start this business ?

1098
01:23:43,167 --> 01:23:47,084
是谁用他的鼻血换来的钱？他们用暴力让我结婚！
Who paid with his nasal septum ? They want me to get married !

1099
01:23:47,251 --> 01:23:50,084
我愿不愿意是另外一回事，不过别再说废话了！
That I won't is another thing, but don't talk shit !

1100
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,084
这真是太无礼了
This really is disrespectful.

1101
01:23:52,251 --> 01:23:54,001
彼得罗，我不想进监狱
Pietro, I don't want to go to jail.

1102
01:23:54,209 --> 01:23:58,001
谁都不会去监狱。我们再做最后一次
Nobody's going to jail. We do it one last time.

1103
01:23:58,209 --> 01:24:03,334
10公斤。1公斤10万，总共100万
Ten kilos. 100,000 a kilo. A million.

1104
01:24:03,542 --> 01:24:06,876
- 这100万卖给谁？   - 批发，给穆雷纳
- Who do we sell a million to ?   - Wholesale. To Murena.

1105
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:08,501
- 谁？   - 穆雷纳
- Who ?   - Murena.

1106
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:11,751
卖给穆雷纳？我打电话给他
To Murena ? I'll call him.

1107
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:16,292
穆雷纳先生，我们见下面。。。我们提供10公斤给你，你给我们100万
Mr. Murena, let's meet at...we give you 10 kilos, you give us 1 million.

1108
01:24:16,459 --> 01:24:20,709
好了？他手里有枪，把我们干掉之后拿货走人。多棒的点子
All right ? He gets a gun, shoots us and takes the stuff. Great idea.

1109
01:24:20,917 --> 01:24:25,792
不，我们有更好的交易地点，那里的人比他要危险得多
No, we have a place for the deal with more dangerous people than him.

1110
01:24:26,334 --> 01:24:28,334
- 在哪？   - 你的婚礼
- Where ?   - Your wedding.

1111
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:33,167
去你妈的！干嘛总盯着我？没看见我的脸成什么样了吗？
Fuck off ! Why is it always me ? Have you seen my face ?

1112
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:36,542
- 什么意思？   - 无论如何都不行
- Why ?   - It can't be done anyway.

1113
01:24:36,751 --> 01:24:41,584
10公斤的药丸，上哪去找这么多丁香酚？去抢药店？
10 kilos of pills, where will be get the eugenol ? Robbing a pharmacy ?

1114
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:49,792
我们要去抢药店？
We're robbing a pharmacy ?

1115
01:25:00,501 --> 01:25:02,709
- 怎么样？   - 做任何事都要有个限度
For example, there's a limit to everything.

1116
01:25:02,917 --> 01:25:07,251
为什么我们做的每件事都要这么离奇曲折？
Why does everything we do have to have a surreal twist ?

1117
01:25:07,417 --> 01:25:09,792
这玩意可以为我们的可靠度加多少分？
What is the temperature of our credibility with this stuff ?

1118
01:25:10,084 --> 01:25:12,584
你疯了吗？它们来自拿破仑的意大利战役
Are you mad ? These are from Napoleon's Italian campaign,

1119
01:25:12,792 --> 01:25:15,126
我们才把它们收进帝峰皇店的目录
we just catalogued them for the Hermitage.

1120
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:18,251
它们来自曼图亚第二次攻防战，由Tunz将军指挥的！
These are from the second siege of Mantua, with General Tunz !

1121
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:21,334
- 好吧，可是它们还能开火吗？   - 它们好用得很
- Yes, but do they shoot ?   - They work perfectly.

1122
01:25:21,501 --> 01:25:25,084
- 我们干嘛要开枪？   - 以防万一的
- Why do we have to shoot ?   - They're for if things go wrong.

1123
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:27,751
什么意思，以防万一？
What does that mean, if things go wrong ?

1124
01:25:28,001 --> 01:25:29,501
我说的就是！以防万一！
What I said ! If things go wrong !

1125
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:32,251
这样某些人就不会再唠叨我仅仅是因为有辆车才在这的
So someone will stop saying I'm only here for the truck.

1126
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:36,001
各位，我是这里唯一一个自欺欺人的吗？
Guys, am I the only person here shitting himself ?

1127
01:25:37,126 --> 01:25:41,209
而且我们还有刺刀。要是用得上的话
And we also have bayonets. If we need.

1128
01:25:48,542 --> 01:25:50,292
- 举起手来，蠢货！   - 这是他妈什么玩意？
- Hands up, dickhead !   - What the fuck is this ?

1129
01:25:50,459 --> 01:25:53,209
手不要碰柜台，敢碰报警器我就开枪
Hands off the counter, don't hit the alarm or I'll shoot.

1130
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:55,501
想死是吗？把该死的手拿开！
You wanna die ? Move your fucking hands !

1131
01:25:55,709 --> 01:25:57,542
这里没有报警器！我们不是在美国！
There is no alarm ! We're not in America !

1132
01:25:57,751 --> 01:26:00,501
他说得对，可怜的家伙，这里不是银行，是药店！
He's right, poor thing, it's not a bank, it's a pharmacy !

1133
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:03,542
我现在很紧张！能不能别打断我的话？
I'm applying psychological pressure ! Why are you breaking my balls ?

1134
01:26:03,751 --> 01:26:06,001
- 因为你话太多了   - 我干我必须做的事。快走！
- Because you're too much.   - I do what I have to do. Move !

1135
01:26:06,209 --> 01:26:08,876
带我们去药品库。我们要所有含丁香酚的东西
Take us to the drugs store. We want everything that contains eugenol.

1136
01:26:09,126 --> 01:26:10,667
香波、沐浴液等等！
Shampoo, bath foam, everything !

1137
01:26:10,876 --> 01:26:14,084
你看什么？聋了吗？带我们去库房！
What are you looking at ? Are you deaf ? Take us to the store !

1138
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:21,376
兹尼教授！4个月前我还接受您的计算化学考试来着。。。
Professor Zinni ! I sat computational chemistry with you four months ago...

1139
01:26:21,917 --> 01:26:24,751
我觉得好奇怪哦，看见你们拿着刺刀站在那儿！
I thought it was strange, standing there with bayonets !

1140
01:26:25,001 --> 01:26:27,834
这算不算是一个人在压力下会有什么反应的测试？
Is this a test to see how people react under stress ?

1141
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:36,876
- 搞什么鬼？   - 安德里亚说过要是出了什么岔子，我们就开枪
- What the fuck ?   - If things go wrong, we shoot.

1142
01:26:37,126 --> 01:26:40,751
- 他认出你来了！   - 我什么都没对你说过！
- He recognized you !   - I didn't say anything to you !

1143
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:42,292
我们就这样杀了人？
We're shooting people now ?

1144
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:44,167
你们疯了吗？你们在干什么？
Are you mad ? What are you doing ?

1145
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:47,292
你本该望风的，看有没有人过来
You're supposed to be the lookout, see if anyone's coming.

1146
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:50,251
当然是有人来了！现在就像列宁格勒包围战！
Of course someone's coming ! It's like the Siege of Leningrad, this is !

1147
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:53,501
把你的脸遮起来，有摄像头！
Cover your face, there are cameras !

1148
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,834
我去把卡车开来。动作快点！我在外面等着
I'm going for the truck. Hurry up ! I'll be waiting outside.

1149
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,084
现在我们把需要的东西带走
Now we'll take what we need and leave.

1150
01:27:00,251 --> 01:27:03,751
我们拿什么呢？库房门有密码锁
What are we taking ? The storeroom has a combination lock.

1151
01:27:04,001 --> 01:27:06,167
你觉得他会输入密码？
You think he can punch in numbers ?

1152
01:27:06,334 --> 01:27:11,376
他在装呢！我瞧过了。药店的人一向如此！
He's acting ! I just grazed him. Pharmacists always act like that !

1153
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:14,084
哦，老天，他状况不太好！
Oh, God, he's in a bad way !

1154
01:27:14,292 --> 01:27:18,709
我不能望了，我要吐了。能不能给我点止吐药？
I can't watch, I'll throw up. Can you get me an antiemetic ?

1155
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:22,084
- 他认识你，我们得把他杀了   - 马蒂亚，搞什么？
- He knows you, we have to kill him.   - Mattia, what the fuck ?

1156
01:27:22,251 --> 01:27:25,376
我没想开枪，只是一时紧张走火了
I didn't mean to shoot, it went off with the nerves.

1157
01:27:25,584 --> 01:27:28,834
- 紧张？   - 总之，他认出你了
- The nerves ?   - Anyway, he recognized you.

1158
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:31,334
- 我们都会被抓起来的   - 那么你是想打死他喽？
- We'll all be arrested.   - So you want to shoot him ?

1159
01:27:31,542 --> 01:27:34,626
还能怎么办？消除他的记忆？嗯？
What else ? Erase his memory ? Eh ?

1160
01:27:37,876 --> 01:27:41,417
我们给他包扎一下送进卡车，好吗？
Let's get some bandages and put him in the truck, all right ?

1161
01:27:48,542 --> 01:27:55,001
冷静！这种情况可以从积极的角度去看
Calm down ! The situation can be viewed from a positive point of view.

1162
01:27:55,209 --> 01:28:00,417
1、他还没死 2、交易完成 3、我没结婚
1, the guy's not dead. 2, the deal's off. 3, I'm not getting married.

1163
01:28:00,626 --> 01:28:03,709
不，交易还在进行。而你明天要去结婚
No, the deal's still on. And you're getting married tomorrow.

1164
01:28:03,917 --> 01:28:06,126
我们手上啥都没有的话拿什么交差？
What pills do we give them if we don't have any ?

1165
01:28:06,334 --> 01:28:07,501
我们不用丁香酚了
We make them without eugenol.

1166
01:28:07,709 --> 01:28:09,626
搞成这样子你却说我们可以不用丁香酚？
After all this we can make them without eugenol ?

1167
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:11,001
- 不全是   - 那么？
- Not really.   - And ?

1168
01:28:11,209 --> 01:28:13,876
- 我还在想   - 他还在想
- I'm thinking about it.   - He's thinking about it.

1169
01:28:14,126 --> 01:28:17,626
彼得罗，说真的，我觉得我们没有时间思考了！
Pietro, to be frank, I don't think there's any time for thinking !

1170
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,417
你必须告诉我们你在做什么
You have to tell us what you're doing.

1171
01:28:19,626 --> 01:28:23,251
这是羟丁酸钠和维柯丁，一种用于嗜睡症，另一种是镇静剂
This is Xyrem and Vicodin, one's for narcolepsy, the other's an opiate,

1172
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:26,251
- 伽玛羟丁酸   - 是什么东西？
- gamma-hydroxybutyric acid.   - What's that ?

1173
01:28:26,417 --> 01:28:29,792
是一种作用于短期记忆的短链脂肪酸
It's a short-chain fatty acid that works on the short-term memory.

1174
01:28:30,084 --> 01:28:32,667
我们已经搞砸了！我们本该杀了他
We've screwed up ! We should have killed him.

1175
01:28:32,876 --> 01:28:34,709
马蒂亚，让他全喝光
Mattia, make him drink it all.

1176
01:28:34,917 --> 01:28:38,167
- 你想消除他的记忆？   - 我正在做尝试
- You want to erase his memory ?   - I'm trying to.

1177
01:28:38,334 --> 01:28:40,626
- 要是不行呢？   - 要是我没弄准剂量
- If you can't ?   - If I get the doses wrong,

1178
01:28:40,834 --> 01:28:44,417
他会从睡眠状态变成昏迷状态直到死亡！
He'll go from sleeping to being comatose to dying !

1179
01:28:44,626 --> 01:28:48,167
闭嘴！安静一会！抱歉，彼得罗！
Shut up! Shut up a minute! Excuse me, Pietro !

1180
01:28:48,334 --> 01:28:53,667
你是说真的你能让人失去记忆？
Are you really saying you can make people lose their memories ?

1181
01:28:53,876 --> 01:28:57,334
你没意识到你在说什么吗？消除人的记忆！
Do you realize what you're saying ? Erase people's memories !

1182
01:28:57,501 --> 01:29:02,126
先生们，这是生死攸关的大事！
Gentlemen, this is an important matter of life and death !

1183
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:06,667
- 怎么说？   - 在奥古斯丁罗马王朝之前，僧侣怎么进行占卜？
- Yes ?    - What did the haruspices do in pre-Augustinian Rome ?

1184
01:29:06,876 --> 01:29:10,584
面对凶兆，僧侣会要求终止行动
Faced with a bad omen, the haruspex said to abandon the operation.

1185
01:29:10,792 --> 01:29:13,876
- 我们不会终止行动的   - 但是历史很少说谎！
- We're not abandoning anything.   - But history rarely lies !

1186
01:29:14,126 --> 01:29:18,542
我才不管！我们说的是做最后一单，而现在我们做的就是
I don't care ! We said we're doing a last deal and we're doing it.

1187
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:20,376
我们手里没有药丸的话，拿什么给穆雷纳？
What will we give Murena if we've no pills ?

1188
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:24,792
我钱包里还有一个。给！
They're not finished, I've got one in my wallet. Here !

1189
01:29:25,084 --> 01:29:28,751
- 零号。我知道   - 各位，相信我
The number zero. I know. Guys, trust me.

1190
01:29:29,001 --> 01:29:31,459
- 你现在给谁打电话呢？   - 我曾经授过课的家伙
- Who are you calling now ?   - A guy I give lessons to.

1191
01:29:31,667 --> 01:29:33,751
我们现在受制于一群毛孩子！
Now we're in the hands of some adolescent !

1192
01:29:34,001 --> 01:29:39,376
毛里齐奥，我是兹尼教授。没事，一切正常
Maurizio, it's Professor Zinni. No, everything's fine.

1193
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:44,084
只是有件事。你父亲那家餐饮公司还开着吗？
Just one thing. Does your father still have that catering company ?

1194
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:23,542
为什么我是七人中唯一一个要做出自我牺牲的？
Why am I the only one out of seven people who has to sacrifice himself ?

1195
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:29,376
又不是领证。只是民间仪式罢了。就像嘉年华
It's not registered. It's folklore. It's like Carnival.

1196
01:30:29,626 --> 01:30:32,834
- 他们来了。我们开始   - 我是认真的
- They're here. Let's start.   - I mean it.

1197
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:38,459
再怎么说，这套西装不错！
This suit is cool, though !

1198
01:30:39,876 --> 01:30:44,084
彼得罗，这么紧张的局面让我心动过速
Pietro, all this tension is causing me a bit of tachycardia.

1199
01:30:44,292 --> 01:30:48,417
当我年轻的时候，我的心脏被诊断出有个小洞
When I was young, I was diagnosed with a little hole in my heart.

1200
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:51,751
因此我不得不终止了体育运动
That's why I had to stop doing sports.

1201
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:54,417
- 我明白   - 我本来有个美好的前途
- I understand.   - I had a promising career.

1202
01:30:54,626 --> 01:30:57,126
阿图罗，别担心，不会有事的
Arturo, don't worry, nothing will happen.

1203
01:30:57,334 --> 01:30:59,376
那些人手里可是真家伙。要是他们开枪怎么办？
These guys have got real guns. What if they shoot ?

1204
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:05,334
辛蒂式婚礼本身就很危险，没人会冲我们开枪的
A Sinti wedding is very dangerous in itself, nobody will shoot at us.

1205
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:10,292
看，穆雷纳把他的合伙人带来了
Look, Murena has brought his partner.

1206
01:31:10,459 --> 01:31:16,001
合伙人，典型的皮条客的女人，一个妓女
Partner, the classic pimp's woman, a hooker,

1207
01:31:16,209 --> 01:31:22,584
站街的，娼妇，不要脸的鸡，荡妇，臭婊子。。。
peripatetic, a whore, a slapper clearly, a slut, a big tart...

1208
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:25,751
看她那张脸，好像在哪见过的样子
Look at her. She's been round the block.

1209
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:28,792
这不是马戏，这是魔术
This is no circus, this is for conjurors.

1210
01:31:29,084 --> 01:31:33,209
- 阿图罗，知道了，马上闭嘴！   - 好吧，我知道了，不说了
- Now you see it, now you don't !   - OK, I get it, stop it.

1211
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:38,376
你看，她和你女朋友长得挺像的，别介意
You know, she's not unlike your girlfriend, no offence.

1212
01:31:38,584 --> 01:31:41,417
阿图罗，她就是我女朋友！
Arturo, she is my girlfriend !

1213
01:31:41,834 --> 01:31:45,751
接下来，籍由赋予我的权力，我宣布你们成为夫妻
And so, by the powers conferred on me, I declare you man and wife.

1214
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:54,001
请等一下。在庆祝之前有一个小小的仪式
Just one moment. There's one small formality before the celebrations,

1215
01:31:54,209 --> 01:31:56,584
在这里签下字，我们就结束了
one signature here and that's us finished.

1216
01:31:57,959 --> 01:32:03,459
- 这只是个仪式，对不对？   - 什么意思？
- It's all folklore, isn't it ?   - In what sense ?

1217
01:32:04,376 --> 01:32:08,709
- 我是说，我要是签了字。。。   - 就算在市政厅注册结婚了
- I mean, I'm just signing...   - It's for the town hall.

1218
01:32:10,126 --> 01:32:11,876
你什么意思，市政厅？
What do you mean, for the town hall ?

1219
01:32:15,876 --> 01:32:19,834
- 10公斤。要是你想称一下的话   - 没必要。我相信你
- 10 kilos. If you want to weigh it.   - No need. I trust you.

1220
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:25,959
不过我得试用一下。给我弄点喝的来，你们俩！
But I need to try them. get me something to drink, both of you !

1221
01:32:34,209 --> 01:32:38,834
彼得罗，我必须得告诉你，你弄的这玩意真不错
Pietro, I have to tell you, this stuff of yours is really good.

1222
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:41,709
以前我并不认为你可以领导他们
I couldn't tell you before for leadership reasons.

1223
01:32:41,876 --> 01:32:46,292
以及你们工作的方式，不过你确实组织了一个很专业的团队
The way you guys work as well, you've got a professional group.

1224
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:51,376
通常我不得不靠手下这些尼安德特人维持生意。。。
I always had to kind of get by with these Neanderthals I've got...

1225
01:32:53,042 --> 01:32:56,792
。。。但有一次也不是那样，像我们这样的人不多
...but one time it wasn't like that, there weren't many like us.

1226
01:32:57,792 --> 01:33:02,709
- 像我们？   - 像我们。人家为什么叫我穆雷纳？
- Like us ?   - Like us. Why am I Murena ?

1227
01:33:03,709 --> 01:33:07,001
因为你是个坏蛋，用了一个和鳝鱼一样的名字？
Because you're a bad guy, like the eel of the same name ?

1228
01:33:07,209 --> 01:33:12,292
不，穆雷纳，就像二战时的意大利皇家海军的海神级潜艇
No, Murena, like the old World War II Triton-class submarine.

1229
01:33:12,501 --> 01:33:15,709
他是个海军工程师，白痴！
He's a naval engineer, dickhead !

1230
01:33:15,876 --> 01:33:21,834
这是家族传统，我祖父设计了龙骨
It's a family tradition, my grandfather designed the keel.

1231
01:33:22,042 --> 01:33:27,834
我擅长流体动力，之后我被踢出了大学校门
I specialized in fluid dynamics, then I got kicked out of university.

1232
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:29,709
把那个给我
Give me that.

1233
01:33:35,834 --> 01:33:36,709
干杯
Cheers.

1234
01:33:48,376 --> 01:33:51,292
挺不错，放到车里去吧
It's good, put it in the car,

1235
01:33:56,834 --> 01:34:02,709
拿去。照顾好你们自己，我会随时跟你们联系。再见，小姑娘
Here. Look after yourself, I'll be in touch. Bye, kid.

1236
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:19,709
你告诉过我要多积累点经验，我不再想当个乖宝宝了
You told me to get some experience, I was too much of a good kid.

1237
01:34:19,834 --> 01:34:22,167
我确实把建议听进去了！
Talk about slavishly following advice !

1238
01:34:22,376 --> 01:34:26,917
信使报的社会新闻第一页！书呆子帮派
Page 1 of the city news in II Messaggero ! The Nerd Gang.

1239
01:34:27,126 --> 01:34:29,876
接下来是共和报，我觉得有点摩尼教的味道
Then La Repubblica which I think was a bit Manichean,

1240
01:34:30,084 --> 01:34:32,584
他们把我们描述成一个研究生吸毒者的帮派，太扯了
they made us out to be a gang of graduate junkies which isn't true,

1241
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:35,376
因为我们都有博士学位，而且只有一个人吸毒
because we've all got doctorates and only one of us was using,

1242
01:34:35,584 --> 01:34:38,001
同时他们还谈到了保镖的情况
and then it was a bit suggestive with the escorts angle.

1243
01:34:38,209 --> 01:34:43,584
重中之重的是，一篇大作，来自我读报，你能看到
Last but not least, the masterpiece, Leggo, which you'll have seen,

1244
01:34:43,834 --> 01:34:46,834
带有法布隆尼的社论，一个评论作家。我来念一下
with an editorial by Fabbroni, a writer of some note. I'll read it.

1245
01:34:47,042 --> 01:34:49,042
- 不，等等   - 我来念一下
- No, wait.   - I'll read it.

1246
01:34:49,251 --> 01:34:53,751
你在那夸夸其谈，让我头很痛。这故事编得漏洞百出
When you talk, I get a headache. This story is full of holes.

1247
01:34:53,917 --> 01:34:57,709
这桩交易中的100万去哪了？
This million from the deal, where did it go ?

1248
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:01,834
哪也没去。根本就没有那100万。彼得罗把我们骗了
To nobody. There was no million. Pietro cheated us,

1249
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:05,251
真正的交易是用10公斤药丸交换朱莉亚
the deal was ten kilos of pills in exchange for Giulia.

1250
01:35:05,459 --> 01:35:08,167
- 但那些药丸是假的啊？   - 它们是用糖做的
- But the pills were fake ?   - They were made of sugar.

1251
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:12,001
是治疗精神病用的香槟，这要谢谢零号药丸
It was the champagne that was psychotropic thanks to the zero pill.

1252
01:35:12,209 --> 01:35:15,209
- 毛里齐奥，听我说   - 说吧，我现在很激动！
- Maurizio, listen to me.   - Tell me, I'm all fired up!

1253
01:35:15,417 --> 01:35:19,001
听我说！在一个特定的时间，他们会要你提供一杯饮料
Listen to me ! At a certain point, they'll ask you for a drink.

1254
01:35:19,209 --> 01:35:22,001
我们就只有这个，你必须把它放进饮料里。非常重要！
This is all we have, you have to put it in the drink. It's important !

1255
01:35:22,209 --> 01:35:24,209
我早就知道你是个中强手！
I knew you were a real hot shot !

1256
01:35:24,417 --> 01:35:27,001
毛里齐奥！他们是真正的坏蛋，他们会开枪的！
Maurizio ! These are real bad guys, they'll shoot us !

1257
01:35:27,209 --> 01:35:28,459
酷！
Cool !

1258
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:29,917
不，不，这杯不能拿！
No, no, not that one !

1259
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:43,001
很不错。放进车里吧
It's good. Put it in the car.

1260
01:35:43,417 --> 01:35:44,334
那个药剂师呢？
And the pharmacist ?

1261
01:35:44,542 --> 01:35:48,751
彼得罗需要他把阿尔贝托弄出来。我们不能把他一个人留在监狱里
Pietro needed him to get Alberto out. We couldn't leave him in jail.

1262
01:35:48,917 --> 01:35:53,876
- 闭嘴！   - 听我说，安静！听我说，听我说，听我说！
Shut up ! Listen to me, quiet ! Listen to me, listen to me, listen to me !

1263

Yes, it's a bit claustrophobic, but this is a bearing pillar, I'm afraid.
