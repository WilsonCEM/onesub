00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,680
他像一个将军一样，控制着进攻
He's, uh, like the general, you know. He's sort of like- he's in charge of the offense.

153
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
四分卫控制着整个进攻
The quarterback is in charge of the whole offense.

154
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:56,210
<i>That'll make it first down, Cincinnati, at the San Francisco 15.</i>

155
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,350

<i>Clock running.</i>

156
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,480
那如果让这个四分卫做后卫，他该怎么办
So what does the quarterback do when he becomes the defense?

157
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,590
什么
What?

158
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,990
如果他的队伍要防守， 那四分卫要怎么做
What does the quarterback do when his team becomes the defense?

159
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,600
四...四...
The quarter...

160
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,660
四分卫绝对不可能打后卫的
The quarter... The quarterback's not on the defense ever. Uh...

161
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,540
我不知道该怎样向你解释
I... Uh, I don't know how to explain this to you.

162
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,080
<i>That's a close one.</i>

163
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,270
还是看比赛好啦
Just watch the game.

164
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,750
<i>The closest men were two offensive linemen.</i>

165
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,360
我觉得这比赛很蠢
I think this game is really stupid.

166
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,960
<i>That really shouldn't be a penalty for throwing the ball away.</i>

167
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,960
<i>The Bengals get a break here.</i>

168
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,960
<i>Watch this pass rush.</i>

169
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,800
那个记录是克雷尔音乐家 在五个世纪前创造的
<i>That recording was made by Krell musicians a half a million years ago.</i>

170
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,110
现在 如果你跟我来 我可以给你看看他们 遗留下来的一些古器物
<i>Now if you will follow me, I will show you some of their other remaining artifacts.</i>

171
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,130
克雷尔金属.  试试你的冲击波吧，指挥官
<i>Krell metal. Try your blaster there, Commander.</i>

172
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,210
此处应该已经被熔化了
<i>This spot should be molten.</i>

173
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,150
可是它甚至没有发热，不是吗？
<i>It's not even warm, huh? </i>

174
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,080
也没有一点放射性
<i> And no trace of radioactivity.</i>

175
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,690
安静，在那
<i>Shh. In there.</i>

176
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,840
喂，我有事和你们商量
<i>Hello, Mae. I've got a bone to pick with you.</i>

177
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,710
<i>- Ouch! Oh! - Uh-huh!</i>

178
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,300
你有吸尘器吗？
Do you have a vacuum cleaner?

179
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,800
什么？这里灰尘太多了
- What? - It's really dirty in here.

180
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,710
你有吸尘器吗？- 你要什么？吸尘器？
Do you have a vacuum cleaner? - What do you want? A vacuum cleaner?

181
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,800
别打开
Don't open that. Oh, man.

182
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,580
吸尘器在床下
The vacuum cleaner's under the bed.

183
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,250
我叫别打开.把下面关上
I told you not to open that. Close the bott...

184
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,850
先关下面，再关上面
The bottom one first, and then the top one.

185
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,320
它在床下 - 在哪？噢
It's under the bed.  - Where? Oh.

186
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:10,670
威利，你能帮我换个集灰包吗？
Willie, can you help me change the bag?

187
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,750
里面好像塞满了东西
It looks full.

188
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,980
它肯定没有问题 只是有好几年没有用了
I'm sure it's fine. It hasn't been used in years.

189
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,610
里面好像很脏 - 艾娃
It looks dirty. - Eva.

190
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,590
是吗
Are you sure?

191
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,100
你知道吗. 你不该这样说 比如 这说法太正式了
You know, you don't say- Like, it's really too formal to say...

192
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,940
”我想清洁地板 我想使用吸尘器“
"I want to vacuum the floor. I want to use the vacuum cleaner."

193
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,950
噢 那你会怎么说
Oh. What do you say?

194
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:46,140
呃 你可以这么说 ”我想让这条鳄鱼窒息“
Well, you say, um, "I want to choke the alligator."

195
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:52,220
所以，如果有人进来，你知道的， 你就说”我正在窒息一条鳄鱼“
So if somebody comes in here, you know, you say, "I'm choking an alligator."

196
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,230
好吧
Okay.

197
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,560
”我正在窒息一条鳄鱼“
I am choking the alligator right now.

198
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,820
没什么
Ba-boo, ba-boo. Nothing.

199
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,040
嗨，威利
Hi, Willie.

200
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,270

你们玩的怎么样 - 挺高兴的
- How're you doing? - Okay.

202
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,050
你们从哪弄来这些东西
Where'd you get all that stuff?

203
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,780
我还以为你身上没有钱
I thought you didn't have any money.

204
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,560
我没有为这些东西花钱
I got this stuff with no money.

205
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,790
这是特意给你的
This one is especially for you.

206
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,890
电视快餐
TV dinner.

207
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,400
谢谢
Thanks.

208
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,400
你做得对，孩子
Whew! Ah, you're all right, kid, I think.

209
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,650
我认为你做得对，孩子
I think you're all right, kid.

210
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,790
他妈的
Damn.

211
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,460
所以我是把整个下午都耗在这了
So I've been losing all afternoon here.

212
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,160
我赢了 - 是的
- I've been winning. - Yeah.

213
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,130
<i>§ I know you're puttin'me down §</i>

214
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,770
§ I put a spell on you §

215
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:58,020
§ Because you're mine §

216
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,250
§ Whoa, yeah §

217
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,250
§ Whoa §

218
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
哦，你好
Oh, hi.

219
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,970
§ Stop the things you do §

220
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,180
他妈的，那是什么？
What the fuck is that?

221
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,350
§ I ain't ly... - §§

222
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,550
我真讨厌那种音乐
I really hate that kind of music.

223
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,650
是尖叫的杰 霍金斯. 他很狂野，因此惹毛你了
It's Screaming Jay Hawkins, and he's a wild man, so bug off.

224
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,290
所以 呃

我觉得有点丑，你不觉得吗？
I think it's kind of ugly. Don't you?

233
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,270
不丑啊.  这是我买的
No. I bought it.

234
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,070

Why don't you try it on?

235
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,650
我不怎么穿这种风格的
I don't really wear this style.

那就等一下，我会去试穿
I'll try it on... later.

238
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,750
嗨，给我留几盒切斯特菲尔德烟
Hey. Leave me some Chesterfields.

239

当然
Yeah, yeah. You can get 'em in Cleveland.

那里买的抽起来也不错吧 像这里一样？
They taste good there, like here?

242
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,030
所有切斯特菲尔德香烟都一样.  - 是吗？

好吧
All right.

245
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,290
你真的不要我跟你去车站吗？
So, you're sure you don't want me to come with you to the station?

246
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,370

我赌平局
I'll bet a deuce.

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,430
平局
And a deuce.

273
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,700
我已经够了
Enough for me.

274
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,870
我同意
I'm in.

275
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,880

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Your five, and five.

你在唬人吧  - 噢 老兄 我也这么觉得 相信我
- I thought you were bluffing. - Oh, man. So did I, believe me.

286
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,120
老兄 我根本不信有这种事
You know, I don't believe this, man.

287
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,920
每次艾迪做庄，威利都赢
Every time Eddie deals, Willie wins.

每次威利做庄，威利也赢
Every time Willie deals, Willie wins.

289
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,900
好像是这样 - 你说什么
Hey, that's right. - What are you saying?

290
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,680
每五手牌，你都要赢两手
I'm saying that you're winning two out of every five hands...

291
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,240
他们总是同样两手牌
and they're always the same two hands!

292
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,040
每五手牌，赢两手. 确实没错
Two out of every five hands. That's right!

293
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,400
你是说我在作弊  - 我可没有这样说
- You sayin' I'm cheatin' then? - I'm not saying you're cheating, man.

294
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,380
那你在说什么？
- Then what are you saying?

00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,280
我是说，每次我们玩，你都赢...
All I'm saying is that every time we go around, you win...

296
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,700
你是怎么赢这么多钱 老兄？我没有必要听
- What are you doing with the money, man? - I don't have to listen to this.

297
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,480
你这话是什么意思？你在说什么？我在作弊？ 我没必要待在这了
What are you meaning that? - What are you talking? You say I'm cheating? I don't have to stay here.

我们他妈的是在比赛. 肏 把你的手拿开
- We're playing a fucking game here, man! - Get your fucking hands off me!

299
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,760

You're his fucking partner too, right?

300
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,590
我根本不认识他 - 我也不会跟你玩牌了

我不知道你们他妈的是怎么回事？
I don't know what the fuck is the matter with both of youse.

307
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,590
你让那些畜生 进了你的门，对不对？
And you let those animals in your fucking house too, right?

308
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,740
威利，我们停下来干什么？
Willie, what are we stoppin' in here for?

309
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,930
我们得注意那些家伙. 他们知道有事发生
We gotta watch those guys. They knew somethin' was up.

Can we borrow a car from Max? - Yeah, I guess.

314
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:14,810
我们用车来干什么？ 就因为那帮家伙就要离开这里？
Hey, what do we want a car for? You want to leave town because of those guys?

315
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,220
不，那帮人属於轻量级选手. 我不会把他们放在眼
No! Those guys are a bunch of lightweights. I don't care about them.

316

我只是想离开几天，去看一些不同的东西，你理解吗？
I just want to get out of here and see something different for a few days, you know?

你不应该如此麻烦他

<i>So, anyway... </i>

443
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,900
行吧  似乎我该去加油站加点油
anyways, it seems it's in the cards that I might be getting a raise down at the gas station.

444
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,580
嘿 你之前说过有一天会和我一起去看电影
Hey, you said you'd go with me to the movies the other night.

威利，我们现在在克利夫兰市

455
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,690
为什么不去看骑士
why don't we go see the Cavaliers?

456
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,780
他们队很糟糕.  - 那又怎么样
Oh, they have a terrible team. - Well, so what?

457
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,690
他们就像0和48或 其它类似的东西一样
They're like 0 and 48 or something like that.

458
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,790
但是，我们现在真是无所事事
Yeah, but we're not doing anything.

459
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,970
那么 你想做些什么
Well, what do you wanna do?

460
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:49,040

我知道自己该做什么
I know what I wanna do.

465
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,440
别我对我指手画脚
No, you don't tell me what to do.

466
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,890
我不是个孩子
I'm not a baby.

467
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:12,890
我不需要他们来照顾我
I don't need them to babysit me.

We came all this way to see you. We could go to the movies with you, right?

473
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,110
好吧  那会很有趣吧 不是吗？
- All right. Okay. - It could be fun. No?

474
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:32,440
唉 我真的不明白为何她把我当成一个孩子
All right. I just don't understand why she's treating me like a baby.

475
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,820
什么？我们是去看电影吗？

我们明天或后天回去
We could go back tomorrow or the next day or somethin'.

490
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:56,990
啊 这真的很有趣
You know, it's funny.

491
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,550
你来到一个新地方， 可一切似乎并无不同
You come to someplace new, and everything looks just the same.

492
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,630

是啊 我也有点想离开这里

495
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,390
我希望洛特阿姨能讲英语
Wish Aunt Lotte would just speak English.

496
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,530
她很顽固 也很滑稽
She's so stubborn. It's funny.

497
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,150
就和这个家里的其它人一样
Just like the rest of the family.

498
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:38,260
是的

502
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,010
有三个小伙子，在街上闲逛
There's three guys and they're walking down the street.

503
00:51:55,110 --> 00:51:59,110
一个小伙子向另一个说：“嗨，你的鞋带散了”
One guy says to the other one, "Hey, your shoe's untied."

504
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,510
那个家伙回答：”我知道“
He says, "I know that."

505
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:03,680
於是，他们继续散步，不对...
And they walk- No.

506
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,690
有两个小伙子在一起逛街
There's two guys, they're walking down the street...

and one says to the other, "Your shoe's untied,"

508
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,370
那个小伙子回答说：”我知道“ 接着，他们走过了两个街区...
and the other guy says, "I know that." They walk a couple blocks further...

509
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,430
他们碰见一个朋友   他走上前说...
And they see a third friend, and he comes up and says...

510
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:19,060
呃  你的鞋...
"H... Your shoe's unti...

511
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:23,200

512
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,210
啊呀 我记不起来了
Uh, I can't remember this joke.

00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:29,910
但它真的很不错
But it's good.

514
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:31,980

嘿 洛特阿姨，这一轮你已经赢了第三次了
Hey, now, that's three times in a row you've won.

不 我真的必须这么做
No, I really should.

527
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,510
噢，比利，你应该能理解吧，嗯？
Oh, come on, Billy! You can understand that, can't you?

528
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,180
别那样对我
Oh, don't give me that.

529
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:47,380
你知道他们并不重要. 只是他们要走
You know they're not more important. It's just that they're leaving.

530
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:50,920
别这样，比利
Come on, Billy.

531
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,230

00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:09,340
它不总是会结冰
It's not always frozen.

547
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:17,950

Hey, Willie, why are you always telling me what to do?

563
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:34,080
我觉得如果我不告诉你要做什么， 你就无所事事
It seems like if I don't tell you what to do, you don't do anything at all.

564
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,850
我要知道到底还剩多少钱. 我们还有550块
- I wanna know exactly how much we got. - We got $550 left.

578
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:18,820
没开玩笑？ - 没
- Yeah? You're not kidding? - No.

579
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:22,020
该死 我们得先回纽约
Well, hell, it beats going back to New York.

580
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,290
好主意
That's a good idea.

583
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,670
下一个出口在哪？
<i>Where's the next exit?</i>

584
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,370
我不希望你把她带走
<i>I don't want you to take her away!</i>

585
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,480
别担心 .我们只是去是度假

586

再见啦
Good-bye.

588
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,830
毫无价值
Good-for-nothing...

589
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,970

天哪 我真高兴. 谢谢你们救我出来
God, I'm so glad. Thank you guys for rescuing me.

591
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,400
我不敢相信我们是去佛罗里达.
I can't believe we're going to Florida.

592
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:22,960
你把你的比基尼带来了吗？- 当然啦
You bring your little bikini along? - Sure.

593
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,930
佛罗里达有鳄鱼吧？
<i>There are alligators in Florida, right?</i>

594
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,860
别放这个 - 这是尖叫的杰的歌
Not that. - It's Screamin' Jay.

595
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,870
真的有够难听
Aw, that's awful.

596
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:07,870
差劲的是你   他是于我很重要的人
You're the same. He's my main man.

597
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,070
§ 'Cause you're mine §

598
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,140
我喜欢这音乐  - 你喜欢这东西？

谢谢你支持我，艾迪.
Thank you, Eddie. Back me up.

600
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,290
§ Stop the things you do §

601
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,520
太可怕了
It's horrible.

602
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,400
§ I ain't lyin' §

603
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,300
这是驾驶音乐
This is drivin' music!

604
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,000
很不错
This is nice.

605
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,630
§ Whoo No runnin' around §

606
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,070
我好久没有听过这音乐了
I haven't heard it in a long time.

607
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,880
§ I know you're puttin' me down §

608
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:59,220
§ I put a spell on you §§

609
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,350
现在，我们真的像游客了
Now we look like real tourists.

610
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,300
非常典型的游客
Pretty classy.

611
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:42,710
艾娃，等那家伙出来，你就躲起来 直到他回办公室
Eva, I want you to stay down until the motel guy comes out and goes back in his office.

612
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:43,410
干吗？
Why?

613
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:46,820
为什么要付三个人的钱？那简直是罚款
Why pay for three people? It's fine.

614
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:48,780
我记得你们说你们有不少钱.
I thought you guys said you were rich.

615
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,490
嘘！ 躲起来，躲起来
Shh! Get down. Get down.

616
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,190
嗨 你好啊 - 嗨 你好
- Hey. How you doing? - Hi there. How are ya?

617
01:04:56,290 --> 01:04:57,290
好了
Fine.

618
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,340
等他进去  就绕到另一边  3号房
Wait till he goes in and then come around the other side. Room number three.

619
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,000
3号房？- 是的
- Number three? - Yeah.

620
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,290
哥们，我太累了
Man, I'm beat.

621
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,360
我也很累
I'm so tired.

622
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,730
什么？你把花生吃完了？
What, you finished the peanuts?

623
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200
是的
Yeah.

624
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,330
那你把这罐子带来干嘛？
Then what'd you pack 'em for?

625
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:58,720
天哪，艾娃
Jesus, Eva!

626
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,590
这个办法就是叫你溜进去. 你知道吗？
The idea was for you to sneak in. You understand?

627
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:05,590
我不在乎
I don't care.

628
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,660
看起来都一样
This looks familiar.

629
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,870
这是给你的
This is for you.

630
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:14,870
啊？- 这是给你的
Huh? - This is for you.

631
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:16,870
噢 不 我不要睡这里
Oh, no. I'm not sleeping on that.

632
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:20,430
你们两个中的哪一个睡那里吧  我要睡床
One of you guys can sleep there. I'm taking the bed.

633
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,710
我在车等的都快睡着了
I fell asleep waiting out there in the car.

634
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,880
我觉得有点冷.  至少要有一张舒适的床吧
Now I'm cold. I want a comfortable bed, at least.

635
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,930
这可真棒
Amazin'.

636
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,970
嗨，那水闻起来有点怪异
Hey, that water smells funny.

637
01:06:51,110 --> 01:06:55,700
啊啊这 在这种小床上我可没法睡觉
Uh-uh-uh. I'm not gonna sleep on this cot.

638
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:00,310
你们觉得这很好笑？
You guys think it's so funny?

639
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:02,020
不，这真的不错 你懂的
No, it's... They're good, you know.

640
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,020
是啊是啊
Yeah, yeah.

641
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,250
我爱你们
I love you guys...

642
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,590
这床真是个”贱货“
but this is a bitch.

643
01:07:14,970 --> 01:07:17,530
我们明天一块去海滩，好吗？
Can we all go to the beach tomorrow?

644
01:07:17,630 --> 01:07:20,100
等我们去完赛马赛之后
After we go to the track.

645
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:27,270
威利，我们应该看一下赛犬
Hey, Willie, we should check out the dog races.

646
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:35,520
我不喜欢赛犬这个主意
I don't like the idea of dog races.

647
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,420
安静，我要睡觉了
Be quiet so I can sleep.

648
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:45,790
睡个好觉，我们才能享受假期，对吧？
Yeah, go to sleep so we can start enjoying our vacation. All right?

649
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,590
好吧
It's okay.

650
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:20,960
看起来不错 - 我原谅你们
- Looks very nice. - I'll forgive you guys.

651
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:29,670
嘿，威利，试试一下赛犬吧
Hey, Willie, man, let's check these dog races out.

652
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:36,770
我有种感觉  我们能赚很多钱
I got a good feeling. I feel like we're gonna make a lot of money.

653
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,340
真的？- 没错，就是这样一种感觉
- Really? - Yeah. It's one of those feelings.

654
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,550
是的
Yeah.

655
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:48,990
可能是个好主意吧  我不知道
Uh, yeah, maybe it's a good idea. I don't know.

656
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,470
赛狗？
Dog races.

657
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,640
做个好梦.
<i>Have sweet dreams.</i>

658
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,350
晚安
<i>Good night.</i>

659
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,210
威利
Willie?

660
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,150
唔...
Mmm.

661
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,490
威利？艾迪
Willie. Eddie?

662
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,200
该死
Shit.

663
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:17,680
他妈的！
Fuck!

664
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,880
很好
That's nice.

665
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,020
他们应该留了便签吧
They could have left a note.

666
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,570
该死
Shit.

667
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,660
我他妈的不相信...
Can't fucking believe it.

668
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,940
假期完美开始
Vacation starts great.

669
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,370
他妈的你这一整天跑哪去了  你连个便条都没留
Where the fuck have you been all day? You didn't even leave me a note.

670
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:31,010
我一个人在这种陌生之地.  一个人都不认识
I'm here alone in the middle of nowhere. I don't know anybody.

671
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:32,610
你不该做这种事
And you can't do that much...

672
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:34,610
你走时，应该给我留张便签
leave me a note when you leave.

673
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,760
闭嘴. 艾娃 - 别叫我闭嘴.  这是什么情况？
Shut up, Eva... - Don't tell me to shut up! What is this?

674
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,980
我想我们正在去迈阿密.这里哪都不是
I thought we were going to Miami. This is nowhere.

675
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:46,120
你说你感觉不错，对吧？- 我感觉不错 威利
- Man, you said you had a good feeling. Right? - I had a good feeling, Willie.

676
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:49,300
你说好事即将发生 根本不该是这样
It's supposed to mean that something's supposed to happen. Not just like this...

677
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,760
威利，我们不是总能赢
You can't win 'em all, Willie.

678
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,760
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

679
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:59,300
是你让我去赌赛狗，你现在说：”我们赢不了？“
You take me to dog races and then you say, "You can't win 'em all"?

680
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:01,530
那是比赛的名称
It's the name of the game!

681
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:04,040
到底怎么回事？没什么
- What's going on? - Nothin'.

682
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:09,500
没什么. 只是几乎输光了我们所有的钱
Nothin's going on. Just lost almost all our money.

683
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:11,580
在赌赛狗上？
At dog races?

684
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,420
你输掉了所有钱？是的
- You lost all the money? - Yeah.

685
01:14:27,660 --> 01:14:28,660
天哪
God.

686
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,610
对不起
I'm sorry.

687
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:01,300
现在我们怎么办？
What are we gonna do now?

688
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,450
听着，威利，我们先离开这
Look, Willie, let's get outta here.

689
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:24,680
我们还有50块，我们回纽约去
We got 50 bucks. Let's go back to New York.

690
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,210
我不打算身无分文的回纽约.  - 你想干什么？
- I'm not goin' back to New York with no money. - What do you wanna do?

691
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,510
我想回到赛场去，赌赛马而不是赛犬
I wanna go to the track and I wanna bet on horses, not on dogs.

692
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,360
我就知道你会这样说
I knew you were gonna say something like this.

693
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,520
拜托，我对回到赛场有一种可怕的感觉
Come on! I have this terrible feeling if we go back to the track.

694
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:39,600
你的感觉没给我们带来任何好处
Your feelings haven't been doing us any good.

695
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:45,330
这真是个伟大的假期  - 闭嘴，艾娃  走吧
- This is a great vacation. - Oh, shut up, Eva. Come on. Let's go.

696
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,340
随你说什么  威利  随你便
Anything you say, Willie. Anything you say.

697
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,840
艾娃，你在做什么？ - 什么意思？
- Eva, what are you doing? - What do you mean?

698
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,120
你别和我们一起走
- You're not coming with us.

699
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,340
她应该和我们一起走.  她能带来好运.  - 她应该呆在这
- Willie, she should come with us. It'll be good luck. - She's stayin' here.

700
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:58,410
我认为她应该来，- 她就待在这
- Willie, I think she should come with us. - She's stayin' here!

701
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,320
出去，滚出去！- 对不起，艾娃
- Get out. Get out! - I'm sorry, Eva.

702
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,250
你也出去 出去！  - 我真的很抱歉
- You're the same. Just go. - I'm sorry.

703
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:11,820
威利，她整天待在汽车旅馆  我们应该带她一起
<i>Willie, she's been in the motel all day. We should take her with us.</i>

704
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,820
你 怪咖 你知道你他妈在哪吗
Yo, little freak, where the fuck you been at, man?

705
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:20,090
你在哪呢 老兄
- Where you been at, man? - Wha...

706
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,380
肏  你...  你真是个怪咖.  不是吗？
Shit, man... Yo, I mean, you the freak, right?

707
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:26,100
你带着这帽子，老兄，我看见这个圆顶了  听着
You got the hat on, man. I see the dome piece on your top, man. Listen.

708
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,100
你应该拿着这个，哥们   你让我想起我该死的母亲
You're supposed to take this shit, man. You make me miss my mother fuckin' sniff, man.

709
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:33,100
拿上这个该死的东西.  告诉兰玫尔，我永远不会再染上这种病
Here, take this shit, man. You tell Rammell that I ain't down with this no more.

710
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:35,910
你酷吗，你清白吗，你该走了，再见  别激动
You cool? You clean? There you go. Good-bye. Peace.

711
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,180
该死的
No shit.

712
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:19,550
威利？艾迪
Willie? Eddie?

713
01:19:36,540 --> 01:19:37,540
呼
Whew.

714
01:20:56,990 --> 01:20:57,990
艾娃
Eva?

715
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:03,660
艾娃？ - 我叫你赌马，而不是赛狗.
- Eva? - I told you horses, not dogs.

716
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,060
你根本不听我的，不是吗
You don't ever listen to me. Right?

717
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:09,120
赌马 赌马 还是赌马好
Horses. Horses. Definitely horses.

718
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:12,130
把这个给我 给我 - 你他妈的滚出去
- Give me that. Give me that! - Get the fuck outta here!

719
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:13,830
快点
Come on.

720
01:21:17,310 --> 01:21:19,210
嘿，天黑了.
Hey, it's dark in here.

721
01:21:19,310 --> 01:21:21,670
你看见"小欢乐"了吗？你看见"小欢乐"了吗？You see Mighty Joy? Did you see Mighty Joy?

722
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,310
是的，他表现得很赞，非常好
Yeah, it was great. He was great.

723
01:21:25,310 --> 01:21:28,120
我想让这地方亮一点
Think I'll shed some light on the situation.

724
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,190
拜托 你个白痴
Come on, you idiot!

725
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:40,520
艾迪，看看这个 - 那是什么？
